## 1.5 Key Terminology and Definitions

### Virtual Asset
As defined in Article 1 of the AML-CFT Decision, a virtual asset is a digital representation of value that can be digitally traded, or transferred, and can be used for payment or investment purposes, excluding:
- Digital representations of fiat currencies
- Securities
- Other funds regulated by competent authorities

Virtual assets typically include: cryptocurrencies, cryptocoins, payment tokens, exchange tokens, and convertible virtual currencies.

**Stablecoins**: May be considered either virtual assets or traditional financial assets depending on their exact nature.

**NFTs**: Non-fungible tokens that are unique and used as collectibles are generally not considered VAs. However, NFTs used for payment or investment purposes in practice may fall under the VA definition.

### Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP)

A VASP is any person—whether individual or company—that conducts any of the following five activities as a business on behalf of others:

1. **Exchange between virtual assets and fiat currencies**
2. **Exchange between one or more forms of virtual assets**
3. **Transfer of virtual assets** - covering any service allowing users to transfer ownership or control of a VA
4. **Safekeeping or administration of virtual assets or instruments enabling control** - entities with ability to exercise control over VAs, including custodial wallet service providers
5. **Participation in and provision of financial services related to an issuer's offer and/or sale of a virtual asset**
