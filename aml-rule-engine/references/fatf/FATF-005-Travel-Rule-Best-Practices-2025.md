## 1. Understanding the Landscape

### 1.1. Background

In 2019, the FATF agreed to extend the application of the FATF Standards to Virtual Assets (VAs) and Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs). Through amendments to Recommendation 15 (R.15) and its Interpretative Note (R.15/INR.15), this required jurisdictions to:

- **License or register VASPs** to prevent them from being misused by criminals or their associates
- **Require VASPs to implement preventative measures**, such as conducting customer due diligence and monitoring for suspicious activity
- **Mandate an authority to apply risk-based supervision** to VASPs to ensure they meet their obligations

The **Travel Rule** requires VASPs and FIs to obtain, hold, and transmit specific originator and beneficiary information immediately and securely when transferring VAs. This payment transparency underpins effective financial investigations and compliance with targeted financial sanctions.

### 1.2. Implementation of the FATF's Travel Rule

The Travel Rule applies the FATF's payment transparency requirements (FATF Recommendation 16) to the VA context. The Travel Rule requires VASPs and financial institutions to obtain, hold, and transmit specific originator and beneficiary information immediately and securely when transferring VAs.

#### Purpose of the Travel Rule

The Travel Rule is a key AML/CFT measure that enables VASPs and financial institutions to prevent terrorists, money launderers, proliferation financiers and other criminals from accessing wire transfers. Specifically, these requirements ensure that basic originator and beneficiary information is available to:

- **Law enforcement authorities** to detect, investigate and prosecute terrorists or other criminals and trace their assets
- **Financial intelligence units** to analyse suspicious or unusual activity
- **Ordering intermediary and beneficiary VASPs and financial institutions** to identify and report suspicious transactions and to freeze funds and prevent transactions with sanctioned persons or entities

### 1.3. Overall Status of Jurisdiction Implementation Since 2024

**Enactment of Travel Rule Legislation**: In 2025, **85 out of 163** surveyed jurisdictions reported having legislation passed to implement the Travel Rule, compared to just 65 jurisdictions in 2024. An additional 14 jurisdictions reported being in the process of implementing the Travel Rule.

**Regional Overview**: There is an increase in implementation across Moneyval and FATF member jurisdictions, partly due to the passing in the EU of the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR) and the revised Transfer of Funds regulation.

Of the 85 jurisdictions that have passed legislation enacting the Travel Rule, approximately half have measures in place to ensure domestic VASPs are only transacting with licensed/registered and/or Travel Rule-compliant counterparts (57%; 49 of 85).

## 2. Evolution and Challenges

### 2.1. The Sunrise Issue

In the context of VA regulation, the **'Sunrise Issue'** refers to the uneven adoption of the Travel Rule across jurisdictions, arising from delays and/or inconsistent standards.

Compliance with the Travel Rule requires VASPs to ensure that certain information requirements accompany payment flows. However, given lack of consistent implementation between jurisdictions, it may not always be the case that both VASPs involved in a transaction will be required by their respective national authorities to comply with the Travel Rule.

As of 2025, 99 out of 164 jurisdictions have implemented the Travel Rule or are in the process of doing so, demonstrating substantial improvement over 2024.

### 2.2. Unhosted Wallets

While peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers are not explicitly subject to AML/CFT controls under the FATF, the 2021 Updated Guidance makes clear that jurisdictions and VASPs must nonetheless mitigate the relevant risks where appropriate. VASPs should:

- Collect the required originator and beneficiary information even when conducting a transfer between their customer and an unhosted wallet
- Verify ownership of unhosted wallets
- Implement adequate transaction monitoring measures

### 2.3. Capacity, Risk Understanding and Training

As VASP supervision is relatively nascent globally, it takes time to develop technical expertise and supervisory and enforcement capacity. The highly technical nature of the Travel Rule has made this common shortcoming more acute.

To address this gap:
- Both VASPs and supervisors should ensure continuous training of their staff
- VASPs should explain the objectives of the Travel Rule and the role it plays in detecting potential illicit activity
- Supervisors should be trained on how to clearly articulate obligations and address deficiencies

### 2.4. Travel Rule Tools: Interoperability Challenge and Tool Deficiencies

While the FATF Standards do not require interoperability between Travel Rule compliance tools, a lack of interoperability can present frictions and reduce a VASPs' ability to fully comply with Travel Rule requirements.

In deciding which Travel Rule compliance tool to adopt, VASPs should consider:
- Interoperability with other tools
- Ability to transact with more counterparties in a Travel Rule-compliant manner
- Tool deficiencies that may complicate compliance

## 3. Good Practices

### 3.1. Pre-implementation Phase

Some jurisdictions have sought to overcome challenges by gaining a robust understanding of their VASP population, including size, risk, and compliance capabilities, ahead of supervising for compliance with Travel Rule requirements.

Collected information could include:
- The VASP's understanding of Travel Rule obligations
- Trading volumes (incl. exposure to jurisdictions that have not implemented the Travel Rule)
- Travel Rule policies and processes
- Travel Rule compliance tools used

#### Example: Singapore (MAS)

Singapore's MAS:
- Engaged with available Travel Rule Compliance tool providers
- Raised industry's awareness via industry engagement sessions
- Issued additional guidance in March 2021
- Supported industry initiatives for independent evaluation of Travel Rule compliance tool providers

#### Example: United Kingdom (FCA)

The FCA divided the VASP population into three groups: high, medium and low risk, allowing it to initially allocate most supervisory resources to category 1 firms deemed most material.

### 3.2. Use of Thematic Reviews Prior to Enforcing Travel Rule Compliance

Supervisors may use thematic reviews based on supervisory information to understand the degree to which VASPs are prepared to comply with Travel Rule requirements.

#### Example: Gibraltar (GFSC)

In 2024, Gibraltar's GFSC launched a thematic review focused on Travel Rule compliance, examining:
- The average number of Travel Rule compliant transactions
- How many VASPs had chosen and started to implement a Travel Rule solution
- Whether solutions were enabling them to meet all key regulatory expectations
- What obstacles for full Travel Rule implementation had been identified

### 3.3. Setting Clear Regulatory Expectations

Effective guidance should:
- Be based on a clear understanding of the ML/TF risks identified
- Be targeted, practical, up-to-date, and actionable
- Outline supervisory expectations (e.g., good practices, bad practices, high-risk areas)
- Be effectively disseminated to the VASP community

#### Example: Hong Kong China

Hong Kong enhanced its AML/CFT requirements in June 2023 with VA specific guidance including:
- Clarification that VASPs are responsible for ensuring Travel Rule compliance when using Travel Rule solutions
- Details on how to meet Travel Rule obligations in transactions involving unhosted wallets

#### Example: Japan

The Japanese Financial Services Agency (JFSA) publishes annually a list of equivalent jurisdictions. As of April 2025, **28 equivalent jurisdictions** have been identified as compliant with Travel Rule.

### 3.4. Building a Risk-based Supervisory Lifecycle

#### Travel Rule Compliance as a Condition for Registration/Licensing

Authorities may consider making compliance with the Travel Rule a prerequisite for the licensing of VASPs. Approaches include:
- **Live demonstrations** (Bahamas)
- **Regulatory sandboxes** (Kazakhstan)
- **On-site reviews at licensing stage** by specialised teams (Hong Kong, Singapore)

#### Use of Third Parties

Supervisors may use third parties (such as external consultants or auditors) to support their AML/CFT functions, including:
- Requiring VASPs to obtain an independent audit/test of their policies, procedures and controls
- Following-up on the adequacy of undertaken remediation

#### Overcoming Capacity and Training Gaps

- Hong Kong's SFC established a specialised team with supervision and AML/CFT expertise
- Use of blockchain analytics tools for sample testing of transaction data
- Gibraltar's GFSC leverages blockchain analytics tools to assess transaction exposure at entity and jurisdiction levels

#### Remedial Actions and Sanctions

Supervisors should have a sufficient range of sanctions available that can be applied proportionately to breaches of supervisory requirements, from remedial actions to formal enforcement actions.

### 3.5. Engagement with Private Sector

Regular information sharing, education and outreach with and across the private sector to improve understanding of risks, including through:
- Public-private partnerships
- Structured dialogues
- Capacity building efforts

#### Example: Singapore

MAS actively conducted industry engagements which led to industry initiatives, including independent evaluations on Travel Rule Solution Providers against FATF R.16 and technology/cybersecurity requirements.

#### Example: India

India established permanent working groups with VASPs to have periodic meetings and discuss Travel Rule as a priority topic. India's FIU is also guiding the establishment of an industry centre of excellence.

## Next Steps

1. The FATF will continue monitoring updates in the VA ecosystem, including the implementation of the Travel Rule by jurisdictions.

2. The FATF will explore potential next steps to promote consistent and timely implementation across all jurisdictions to address the Sunrise Issue.

3. The revised R.16/INR.16 adopted in June 2025 will have implications for the VA sector. FATF will address in upcoming guidance how the new framework will apply to VAs and VASPs.
