# I. INTRODUCTION 

The development and massive global adoption of the use of the Internet, personal computers, 

mobile devices, services and platforms associated with them, has had a vast impact on the speed 

and nature of social interactions, and commercial or financial transactions are not exceptions. 1 One 

of the expressions of the transition of human activity from the p hysical to the virtual world has 

been the emergence of virtual assets (VAs), understood, according to the definition of the Financial 

Action Task Force (FATF), as a digital representation of value that can be digitally exchanged or 

transferred, and used as a form of payment or investment instrument. 2 In this scenario, the most 

important development has undoubtedly been the creation of cryptocurrencies, which since their 

birth in 2008 —with the publication of the famous “White paper” by Satoshi Nakamoto on 

Bitcoin 3—have become one of the largest unregulated markets in the world. 4

The emergence of cryptocurrencies and the underlying “distributed ledger technology” (DLT) 

(exemplified by the Blockchain) is a phenomenon that may well be set to positively revo lutionize 

many aspects of the financial system. However, like many innovations, it is also susceptible to 

being exploited to favor illicit activities. The use of bitcoins, or similar cryptocurrencies that 

emerged later, known generically as “Altcoins,” all ows anyone —regardless of whether they are 

engaged in a legal or criminal activity —to transfer value almost instantaneously at little or no cost, 

with minimal entry barriers and with no paper trail. 

Criminals, usually adept at adopting new technologies, qu ickly realized that the particular 

characteristics of Bitcoin could be useful to their interests. This resulted in the use of this 

cryptocurrency to facilitate the emergence of online marketplaces on the “dark web” of the 

Internet, where (mostly) illegal g oods and services are still exchanged in exchange for bitcoins. 

The adoption of Bitcoin as the main exchange currency for criminal activity in cyberspace became 

apparent from the shutdown of Silk Road —the first illicit online marketplace —by US authorities in 

2013. Since then, references to the use of cryptocurrencies for illicit purposes have been 

repeatedly made in documents from various law enforcement agencies or organizations. Thus, 

Europol’s Internet Organized Crime Threat Assessment (IOCTA) reports n oted the growing 

adoption of Bitcoin as a preferred currency among criminal organizations, replacing other VAs. 5 In

this context, a recent study estimates that 26% of Bitcoin users and 46% of Bitcoin transactions 

are associated with illegal activities. 6

Specifically with regard to money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF), one of the first 

mentions of the possibility of using bitcoins for this purpose can be found in an FBI report 

produced in 2012. 7 Since then, numerous documents from organizat ions dedicated to crime 

prevention in general and money laundering in particular have confirmed the consolidation of the 

use of cryptocurrencies as a method to recycle illicit funds coming not only from criminal activities 

in cyberspace (online sale of ill egal goods and services, ransomware , extortion, VA theft through 

hacking, etc.), but also from crimes committed in the physical world. 

The FATF had already warned about the possibility that the evolution of information and 

communication technologies (ICT s) could generate new ML/TF vulnerabilities and typologies in its 

report on new payment methods, published in 2006. 8 The issue was revisited in a 2010 report 9

that highlighted the growth in the number of cases of illicit use of new payment methods report ed 

by member countries, while highlighting the importance of implementing customer due diligence 

(CDD) measures at access points to these new technologies as a way to mitigate ML risks. 

Subsequently, cryptocurrencies became increasingly prevalent among n ew payment methods until 

they took a central role as an exchange currency in illicit transactions. The FATF addressed the 

issue in the report on “virtual currencies” published in 2014, 10 in which it analyzed the ML/TF risks 

linked to cryptocurrencies, whic h it considered particularly vulnerable to exploitation for criminal 

purposes. A year later, in its “Guidance for a risk -based approach: virtual currencies” 11 the FATF 

set out a series of guidelines for better implementation of the 40 Recommendations in or der to 

minimize potential risks, highlighting, once again, the desirability of focusing AML/CFT measures 

on the intersection between the cryptocurrency and fiat currency ecosystems. 

In these reports, the FATF identified the following as the main features that increase ML/TF risk: 

(a) the anonymity associated with the design of VAs (which can even be increased through the use 

of tools such as “mixers” or “tumblers”; (b) the possibility of the same person controlling multiple 

“virtual wallets”; (c) the decen tralized nature of most cryptocurrencies (which implies the lack of a 

supervisory body covered by AML/CFT regulations); and (d) the global reach of many of them, 

among others.

In response to this, in October 2018, the FATF updated Recommendation 15, refe rring to the 

fundamental obligations of member countries with respect to the risk -based approach (RBA) 

towards new technologies, in order to clarify its application to VAs, activities related thereto, and 

to VA service providers (or VASPs). 12 Then, in 2019 , the FATF adopted a new Interpretative Note 

to Recommendation 15 to further clarify how standards and measures for the regulation and 

supervision of the activities of VAs and VASPs should be applied. 

In the same year, the FATF published a guide with rec ommendations for an RBA. 13 In that guidance 

it highlighted the risks arising from the inconsistent application, at the international level, of the 

body’s parameters for the AML/CFT obligations of VASPs, noting that, given the inherently cross -

border nature of the Internet, a VASP based in one jurisdiction may offer its products and services 

to customers located in any other, where it is subject to different duties and supervisory standards, 

which is a concern when the provider is located in a jurisdiction w ith weak or non -existent controls. 

Then, in September 2020, the FATF issued updated guidance on VA risk indicators and red flags. 14 

Vulnerabilities resulting from regulatory divergences are accentuated due to the wide range of 

providers in the AML/CFT field and their presence in multiple jurisdictions, which make it difficult 

to determine which entities or persons (natural or legal) in volved in these types of transactions are 

subject to AML/CFT measures and which country or countries are responsible for regulating and 

supervising compliance. Likewise, in a subsequent report on “so -called stablecoins,” 15 the FATF 

recognized the existence of identical risks in relation to this type of VA. 16 

At the regional level, the Group of Experts for the Control of Money Laundering of the 

Organization of American States (OAS) highlighted the ML/TF risks associated with 

cryptocurrencies. On the European continent, the issue of virtual currencies was first analyzed in 

a 2012 European Central Bank (ECB) report. 17 The following year, the European Banking Authority 

(EBA) issued a warning to consumers regarding VAs, 18 stating that the illicit use of such assets 

could put their funds at risk. To mitigate such risks, it recommended including virtual currencies in 

the scope of the European Anti -Money Laundering Directive (AMLD). Then, in an opinion issued

in 2014, 19 the s ame entity identified more than 70 risks associated with virtual currencies, while 

reiterating the need for regulation on the matter. The EBA reiterated this position in a subsequent 

opinion, published in 2016. 20 

Moreover, the 2019 Internet Organized Cri me Threat Assessment (IOCTA) highlighted the use of 

cryptocurrencies to facilitate online crime, urging law enforcement agencies (LEAs) to develop, 

share, and propagate knowledge on how to recognize, track, seize, and recover VAs. 21 More 

recently, a joint paper by Interpol, the on Basel Institute on Governance and Europol also 

emphasized the importance of member countries or states establishing clear regulatory 

frameworks and processes to support the AML/CFT registration and supervision of VASPs, in line 

wi th FATF recommendations. 22 Similarly, in 2020, both the Financial Stability Institute and the 

Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published documents highlighting the existence of 

ML/TF risks arising from the use of cryptoassets and the need for adequat e regulation. 23 

Likewise, during the last decade, the concern of international organizations regarding the possible 

use of cryptocurrencies to facilitate the financing of terrorism, especially as a means to (semi -)

anonymously channel donations or contrib utions to terrorist organizations, has been accentuated. 

In this regard, the 2012 ECB report on virtual currencies already emphasized, in relation to the 

emergence of Bitcoin, that the degree of anonymity associated with this asset posed a TF risk. In 

turn , the EBA explained, in 2014, that the TF risk resulting from the use of virtual currencies 

derives from the fact that the schemes referred to these assets are not restricted by jurisdictional 

boundaries, since they are accepted across borders. In this reg ard, it pointed out that all that was 

required to operate with VAs was an Internet connection; that the underlying infrastructure was 

distributed around the globe, making it difficult to intercept transactions; and those transactions 

tended to be irreversib le. 24 

Following the terrorist attacks in France in 2015, the European Commission proposed to analyze 

vulnerabilities in TF prevention policies on that continent, including those linked to the anonymous 

acquisition and use of virtual currencies. As a resu lt, in 2016 the European Commission agreed to 

include measures similar to those recommended by the FATF and the EBA in respect of VAs in the 

5th European Anti -Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD), which was adopted by the European 

Parliament in April 2018 an d by the Council of Europe in May of the same year.

Notwithstanding the above, a 2018 European Parliament report noted, in relation to these risks, 

that the number of extremists who have turned to cryptocurrencies (attracted by the perception 

of anonymit y and their decentralized structure) is still low. It was explained, in this regard, that, in 

the short term, the most significant risk comes from the possibility of using VAs to purchase illegal 

items (such as weapons or explosives) on the Dark Web, or to raise funds through anonymous 

donations. 25 The report concludes, however, that for the time being VAs do not provide substantial 

benefits for most terrorist organizations compared to established TF methodologies. 26 

The challenge of maintaining AML/CFT s tandards in the new scenario posed by the widespread 

global use of cryptocurrencies as currency (both in the context of licit and illicit transactions) is not 

limited to updating regulatory frameworks so that registration, information, and reporting 

obliga tions also reach the VAs and VASPs that are continually being incorporated into the global 

financial markets. This is because, given the special characteristics of VAs, their exploitation for 

illicit purposes may affect the effectiveness of asset investiga tions and the possibility of seizing or 

confiscating assets of illicit origin or destination, both aspects that have been considered by the 

FATF as central elements of the AML/CFT standards and of the national regimes on the matter. 27 

Indeed, the fact th at transactions with cryptocurrencies and other similar VAs take place almost 

entirely in a virtual environment and almost completely detached from the physical world (the so -

called “cyberspace”), imposes a paradigm shift in everything related to the strat egies, methods, and 

tools used to investigate, prosecute, and punish ML/TF activities committed through VAs, as well 

as for the seizure and confiscation of the funds involved in them. 

Thus, since the existence of cyberspace means that crime is no longer territorial and borders 

become irrelevant to the perpetrator, criminals are favored, and law enforcement agencies are 

harmed. The process of investigation and evidence gathering is drama tically changed, forcing the 

use of technological tools to carry out tasks with already established procedures. In such a context, 

there are complexities in the prosecution of crimes, which is hampered by factors such as 

difficulties in government procurem ent of technological tools, limited use of ICTs by LEAs, and 

certain biases in the culture of LEAs regarding the needs and skills required for the use of new 

technologies. 28 

In order to sustain the effectiveness of asset investigations in the virtual env ironment, with all the 

challenges that this entails, the national authorities in charge of investigating, identifying, seizing,

and confiscating VAs need to adapt their approach to the new technological reality in which they 

must operate. This adaptation d emands the adoption of new investigation strategies based on the 

scenario created by the technological evolution of the last two decades, with a multidisciplinary 

approach and using new investigative tools linked to information technology, in line with FAT F

Recommendations 30 and 31. 

In this scenario, the purpose of this guide on relevant aspects and appropriate steps for the 

investigation, identification, seizure, and confiscation of VAs is to offer ideas, concepts, and good 

practices that are useful for all operators in GAFILAT member countries to ensure greater 

efficiency in investigations related to criminal maneuvers involving VAs, their seizure and 

confiscation. In view of the differences between the various national jurisdictions in which they 

may b e applied, these ideas, concepts and good practices are presented in general terms, leaving 

it up to the authorities of each country to define how they should be adapted to the normative, 

regulatory, political, economic, and social reality of their territo ry. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the

# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

This “Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the Investigation, Identification, 

Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets” is the first best practices document prepared by 

GAFILAT on the subject, with the aim of promoting the development and strengthening of 

capacities for the identification and localization of this type of assets by GAFILAT’s Asset Recovery 

Network (RRAG) contact points and, through them, specialized units of the Public Prosecutor’s 

Office, law enforcement agencies, and othe r investigative agencies dedicated to the identification, 

seizure, and confiscation of assets linked to ML/TF in Latin America. In this regard, the purpose of 

this guide is to offer ideas, concepts and good practices that are useful for all operators in GA FILAT 

member countries to ensure greater efficiency in investigations related to criminal maneuvers 

involving VAs, their seizure and confiscation. In particular, it aims to help reconcile the regulatory 

structures, tools and strategies currently in use for asset investigation and asset recovery —

designed to be used for ML/TF operations carried out in the “physical” or “real” world —with the 

new scenario represented by the emergence of VAs, the specific scope of which is cyberspace. 

Over the last decade, VAs, and especially cryptocurrencies, have come to occupy a central place 

as a currency of exchange in illicit transactions carried out, above all, in illegal marketplaces 

operating on the Internet. The FATF has referred to them in different documents publishe d since 

2014, in which it identified anonymity associated with the design of VAs, the possibility of the 

same person controlling multiple “virtual wallets,” the decentralized nature of most 

cryptocurrencies, and the global reach of many of them, among othe rs, as the main features that 

increase the risk of ML/TF. The evolution of this phenomenon resulted in the agency updating 

Recommendation 15 and developing its Interpretative Note, referring to the fundamental 

obligations of member countries with respect t o the RBA related to new technologies, in order to 

clarify its application to VAs, related activities, and VASPs. 

In this regard, the guide contains a detailed analysis of the problems inherent to the investigation, 

seizure, and confiscation of VAs of ill icit origin or used for ML/TF, describing both the typologies 

associated with this type of assets, the technological context in which they are developed, the 

tools available to criminals to hinder the action of the authorities, and the consequences arising 

from their use. It also describes the aspects of the new technological ecosystem that favor the 

action of the LEAs, the new investigation strategies and techniques that can be adopted, and the 

technological tools available for this purpose. 

Taking as a s tarting point the scenario described above, the guide lists a series of recommendations 

related to the effective regulation of VA ecosystem’s operators (with special emphasis on those 

that serve as a nexus between fiat and virtual currency); the sources of information available to 

LEAs to feed asset investigations on ML/TF conducts involving VAs; the identification of “red 

flags” on the possible configuration of this kind of behaviors; the elements of the technological 

architecture that supports the use of VAs, which can be exploited for greater effectiveness in Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the

investigations; their combination with traditional investigative measures and those that have 

emerged in recent decades from the evolution of VA technologies, and communication 

technologies (ICTs) (i n particular, automated or electronic surveillance tools, the undercover 

computer agent, and the use of spyware); and everything related to the planning and execution of 

seizure or confiscation of VAs, including their treatment once they are in possession of the 

authorities. It also includes recommendations on personnel training and international cooperation 

in the investigation, seizure, or confiscation of VAs, including a list of international agencies or 

organizations that can be called upon for this pur pose. 

As a complement, the guide includes an annex with a synthesis of all the recommendations 

contained in the main document, in order to facilitate their analysis by the LEAs and/or specialized 

units of the Public Prosecutor’s Office, as well as the co ntact points of the RRAG, to whom this 

document is addressed. It also includes a second annex with comparative legislation on the 

regulation concerning the use of advanced computer tools for investigation or surveillance, which 

may be useful either as a re ference for their eventual incorporation into the procedural regulations 

of the countries of the region or for their analogical application, where possible, in accordance 

with the legal principles in force. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the

# II. METHODOLOGY 

A. Starting Point 

1. Within the framework of the conclusions, recommendations, and priorities outlined at the 

XVII General Meeting of the GAFILAT Asset Recovery Network (RRAG) Contact Points, which 

took place in November 2020, the possibility was raised of developing good prac tices or technical 

documents on topics of interest to contact points and their institutions, including the investigation, 

identification, seizure, and confiscation of VAs and the implementation of special investigative 

techniques. 

2. In particular, it was n oted that the development and strengthening of skills for the 

identification and tracing of VAs is an inevitable challenge for the RRAG’s contact points. In this 

regard, the members of the Network themselves identified this problem as a central aspect for the 

development of their tasks and made it a priority. 

3. This “Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the Investigation, 

Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets” is the result of this recognition. It is 

addressed to RRAG con tact points and, through them, to specialized units of the Public 

Prosecutor’s Office, law enforcement agencies, and other investigative agencies dedicated to the 

identification, seizure, and confiscation of ML/TF -related assets in Latin America. 

4. The pur pose of this guide is to help reconcile the regulatory structures, tools, and strategies 

currently in use for asset investigation and asset recovery —designed to be used for ML/TF 

operations carried out in the “physical” or “real” world —with the new scenari o represented by the 

emergence of VAs, the specific scope of which is the “virtual” world or cyberspace. 

B. Scope 

5. In view of the objectives set out for the guide, its scope is limited to the analysis of issues 

that have a practical impact on the investigati on of ML/TF conducts involving VAs. Therefore, the 

general study of the phenomenon known as “Fintech” (understood as the confluence between 

technology and the provision of financial products and services) is excluded, within which the 

emergence of VAs (and especially cryptocurrencies) represents only one of the multiple variants 

within a much broader universe, comprising a wide range of activities that includes the provision 

of banking services through digital channels not associated with banking institutio ns, credit 

assessment based on alternative data, peer -to -peer (P2P) lending to the unbanked, the use of 

blockchain technology for smart contracts, digital currencies issued by central banks, initial 

offerings of virtual currencies, and algorithmic investme nt strategies, among others. 

6. The focus of the analysis is on the problems related to centralized and decentralized VAs, 

with special emphasis on the use of cryptocurrencies for ML/TF purposes. This also Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets

15 

includes the “so called stable -coins.” This is beca use this type of asset presents many of the same 

ML/TF risks found in other VAs, stemming from their potential for anonymity, global reach, and 

their possible use for the layering of illicitly sourced funds. These vulnerabilities increase in the 

event that these currencies are massively adopted, which, although it has not yet occurred, may 

happen in the near future with the release of “stable currencies” sponsored by large financial, 

technology, or telecommunications companies. 29 

7. Likewise, with regard to cryptocurrencies, it is important to bear in mind that, although 

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple are the best known, in practice all of them are, to a greater or lesser 

extent, susceptible to being exploited for ML/TF. However, given the vast amount of this type of 

VAs in circulation (as of March 2020, there were 5,183 known cryptocurrencies), 30 the main focus 

is on Bitcoin, which holds a predominant place in the market, as well as on widely used Altcoins, 

and on the so -called “private currencies,” such as Monero and ZCash. 

8. This guide has been conceived to be applied in the 17 countries that make up GAFILAT, 

which represent a geographical, political, and social diversity, which in turn results in a great 

diversity in terms of the regulatory reality prevailing in each jurisdic tion, as well as the integration 

and operation of the agencies in charge of the investigation, seizure, and confiscation of ML/TF -

related assets. Consequently, both the analysis and the recommendations are made on a general 

basis, so that the addressees of the recommendations can adapt their provisions to the specific 

context of each country where they are to be applied. 

C. Methodology 

9. The analysis carried out for the purpose of preparing this guide included the following 

issues: (a) the functioning of VAs, the ML/TF risks associated with them and the consequent need 

for effective regulation, at the international level, aimed at mitigating them; (b) the special 

characteristics of the investigation of crimes committed in the virtual environment (including 

ML/ TF conducts with VAs), the difficulties related to the identification of those responsible, the 

reconstruction of the transactions, and the confiscation or seizure of the funds involved; and (c) 

the new technological tools available to LEAs to achieve grea ter effectiveness in asset 

investigations related to the matter. 

10. In this context, a diagnosis was prepared on the situation in Latin America in relation to the 

treatment of VAs, the supervision of persons or entities that provide services related to them 

(VASPs), and the possible implementation of new strategies and technological tools in order to 

achieve greater effectiveness in asset investigations related to ML/TF conducts involving VAs.

11. To this end, a survey of the regulatory and normative reality o f the region was carried out 

by means of a questionnaire addressed to GAFILAT countries, in addition to the RRAG contact 

points. This survey emphasized two central issues: 

a) In the first place, the situation regarding compliance with the standards establish ed in 

FATF Recommendation 15 and its Interpretive Note (as well as the guidelines and 

reports of the organization in relation to the matter) in order to regulate the duties of 

AML/CFT in terms of VAs and VASPs. This is because the degree of adequacy they 

present not only has an impact on the possible generation of alerts on suspicious 

ML/TF transactions involving this type of assets, but also on the possibility that the 

agencies in charge of the investigation, identification, seizure, and confiscation of VA s

have a source of accurate and detailed information about the natural or legal persons 

that operate with this type of assets, which may be of paramount importance for the 

success of the asset investigations that target them. 

b) Second, the identification of the resources available to the LEAs or specialized units of 

the Public Prosecutor’s Offices in Latin America to investigate, identify, seize, and 

confiscate VAs. In this context, an attempt was made to determine the regulatory 

situation in the region in te rms of the possible adoption of the technological 

investigation techniques and tools described above, which is essential for an effective 

identification and prosecution of ML/TF activities related to cryptocurrencies. 

12. The result of this survey constitute d the fundamental input for the preparation of a 

diagnosis on the situation of the region in the face of the new scenario of the growing adoption 

VAs and their potential exploitation for ML/TF. However, to that effect, the information obtained 

by GAFILAT i n the framework of the 4 th Round of Mutual Evaluations on compliance with FATF 

Standards, particularly to Recommendation 4 and 38, was also analyzed, as well as that collected 

by the OAS Group of Experts for the Control of Money Laundering as a result of a study on 

cryptocurrencies agreed at the meeting of that group in 2016, in the framework of which a 

questionnaire was circulated between 2017 and 2018. 

13. In addition, other inputs were taken into consideration such as: 

• Interviews with officials from the Organization of American States (OAS), CARIN, 

World Bank, and ICAR. 

• Documents published by various international organizations, starting with FATF 

reports and guidelines and continuing with documents from Interpol, Europol, the Basel 

Institute on Gove rnance, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Financial 

Stability Institute (FSI), CARIN, the Association of Certified Anti -Money Laundering Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the

> 17

Specialists (ACAMS), the European Central Bank (ECB), the European Banking 

Authority (EBA), the European Parliament and the FBI, among others (as well as in 

numerous academic publications on the subject) reflecting the ML/TF risks associated 

with VAs and the consequent need for effective regulation, at the international level, 

aimed at mitigating them. 

• Docum ents from international organizations and academic material referring to the 

operation of VAs in general and cryptocurrencies in particular, reflecting both the 

obstacles they pose for a financial investigation, as well as the possibilities that such 

opera tion offers for obtaining evidence and/or relevant information for the 

identification and prosecution of ML/TF conducts with VAs. As well as with regard to 

the seizure and/or confiscation of this type of assets. In this regard, the guides 

published on the subject by the FATF, UNODC, the Council of Europe and the Regional 

Organized Crime Information Center (ROCIC) stand out. 

• Documents from international organizations and academic material on the impact of 

technological advances on the investigation of cyber crime, and the need to adopt new 

strategies and implement the use of new tools in order to effectively combat this type 

of crime. For example, documents published by the OAS Working Group on 

Cybercrime, the Basel Institute on Governance, the European Parli ament, Interpol, 

Europol, the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) and the Police 

Executive Research Forum (PERF). 

• International instruments related to the implementation of innovative tools for the 

investigation of cybercrime, including t he Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime 

(Budapest Convention); the ITU/CARICOM/CTU Model Legislative Texts, the Draft 

African Union Convention, the Commonwealth Model Law, the ECOWAS Draft 

Directive and the League of Arab States Convention. There are also examples of 

specific regulation of the use of new surveillance or technological research techniques 

in Spain, France, England, the Netherlands, and Poland. 

D. Elaboration Process 

14. The process of preparing the guide was divided into four phases or stages : 1. Preparatory 

stage; 2. Study stage; 3. Diagnostic stage and preliminary report; and 4. Final stage. 

15. The Preparatory stage included the compilation and analysis of reports from specialized 

agencies and academic material on the issues covered by this g uide, as well as the preparation, in 

coordination with the GAFILAT Executive Secretariat and the German Development Cooperation 

implemented by GIZ, of the draft questionnaire addressed to GAFILAT countries and RRAG 

contact points in order to obtain informa tion on: (a) local regulation on cryptocurrencies; (b) local Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets
> 18

AML/CFT regulation in relation to VASPs; (c) local regulations on seizure and confiscation; and (d) 

local procedural regulations on technological and/or IT investigative techniques. 

16. During the Study stage, the Work Plan was developed together with GAFILAT’s ES, which 

coordinated the distribution of the questionnaires. Then, the responses received were compiled 

and systematized, and finally, interviews were held with representatives of the OAS, C ARIN, the 

World Bank, and ICAR. 

17. In the Diagnostic phase, based on the information gathered during the previous phases, an 

assessment was made of the regional situation regarding the regulation, investigation, seizure, and 

confiscation of VAs, identifying the sources of information and the legal tools provided for in the 

regulations, as well as the margin for action for the implementation of new technological research 

measures. 

18. In the final stage, and taking this diagnosis as a starting point, a preliminary report was 

prepared, focusing on the identification of strategies for the effective use of the contact points 

between the “virtual” and the “physical” universe in asset invest igations, as well as investigative 

methods and tools appropriate to the reality of cyberspace and the current technological context. 

19. The last step consisted of drafting the final document and its approval by the GAFILAT 

Executive Secretariat.

# III. DEFINITIONS 

Related to virtual assets 

22. Virtual Asset (VA): As defined by the FATF, a digital representation of value that can be 

digitally exchanged or transferred and used as a form of payment or investment instrument. VAs 

do not include digital representations of fiat currency, securities, and other financial a ssets that 

are already covered elsewhere in the FATF Recommendations. 

23. Fiat money: It refers to real (non -virtual) currency or money, or national currency. It differs 

from virtual currency in that it functions as the currency and paper money of a country, designated 

as legal tender; it circulates, is used, and accepted as a means of exchange in the country of 

issuance. 

24. Convertible (or open) virtual asset: It is one that has an equivalent value in fiat currency 

and can be converted from or into that type of currency. Examples: Second Life Linden Dollars, or 

WebMoney. 

25. Non -convertible (or closed) virtual asset: It is intended to be specific to a particular domain 

or virtual world, such as those created within the “Massively Multiplayer Online Role -Playing 

Games” (MMORPG) or Amazon.com, which is why the rules that regulate their use prohibit 

exchanging them for fiat currency. Examples: Project Entropia Dollars, Q Coins, and World of 

Warcraft Gold. This does not imply that non -convertible VAs can be traded for fiat currency (or 

cryptocurrencies) in a secondary market, which may be subject to sanctions by the administrator. 

All non -convertible virtual assets are centralized. 

26. Centralized virtual assets: They are those that answer to a single central authority 

(a dministrator), which is a third party that controls the system. The administrator issues the VA, 

sets the rules for its use, maintains a central ledger of payments, and has the authority to redeem 

the currency (withdraw it from circulation). Examples: Exam ples: Second Life “Linden dollars,” 

PerfectMoney, WebMoney “WM units,” and World of Warcraft gold. 

27. Decentralized virtual assets: These are distributed, open -source, peer -to -peer virtual 

assets without a central management, monitoring, and supervisory authority. The main exponents 

of decentralized VAs are cryptocurrencies. 

28. Cryptocurrencies: These are open source, convertible and d ecentralized VAs that operate 

in a distributed peer -to -peer network that applies mathematical and cryptographic principles to 

provide security to the system. Transfers between users are carried out “peer -to -peer,” without 

intermediaries, based on a set of public and private cryptographic keys, and require cryptographic 

signature to be completed. The transparency of the system is ensured by the recording of Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets
> 20

transactions in a sort of distributed “ledger” (called Blockchain in most cryptocurrencies), 

maintaine d by a network of mutually “untrusted” parties (called “miners” in the Bitcoin and other 

cryptocurrencies ecosystem) that elaborate the cryptographic blocks of the chain and are 

rewarded for it with fees paid by the users. 

29. Bitcoin: Launched in 2009, it wa s the first decentralized convertible VA, and the first 

cryptocurrency. Bitcoins are account units composed of unique alphanumeric sequences that 

constitute units of currency (divisible, in turn, into smaller units, called Satoshis) and have value 

only bec ause individual users are willing to pay for them. Bitcoins are traded digitally between 

users in a partially anonymous form (the persons or entities involved in each transaction are 

identified only by alphanumeric pseudonyms called “Bitcoin addresses”) an d can be exchanged for 

fiat currency or other cryptocurrencies. The software required to send, receive, and store bitcoins 

or to monitor transactions can be downloaded free of charge. Users can also obtain their Bitcoin 

addresses (which function as account s) from Bitcoin exchange platforms or online wallet services. 

Transactions (flows of funds) are recorded in a shared public registry (the “blockchain”), where they 

are identified by Bitcoin addresses. 

30. Altcoin: The term refers to any mathematically grounde d decentralized convertible virtual 

currency that is mathematically distinct from the original Bitcoin. There are currently thousands of 

Altcoins. Among the most important ones, the following are worth mentioning: 

a) Litecoin (LTC) was launched in 2011. It was one of the first Altcoins after Bitcoin. While it 

resembles the latter in many respects, block generation is faster, which increases the speed 

of transaction confirmation. 

b) Ethereum (ETH) : It is a decentralized software platform that allows the execut ion and 

development of “Smart contracts” and distributed applications (DApps) without 

interference from third parties. Ether is the cryptographic token with which Ethereum -

based applications run. 

c) Dash (DASH) : Originally known as Darkcoin, it is a more priv ate version of Bitcoin. It offers 

a higher level of anonymity, as it runs on a decentralized network that makes it difficult to 

trace transactions. 

31. Ripple (XRP): It is a global payment clearing network that offers the possibility of instant, 

certain, and low -cost transfers. Its registration does not require mining (which distinguishes it from 

most cryptocurrencies), which reduces the use of computational capacity and latency (delay) in the 

network. 

32. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) : It is a derivation of Bitcoin, whose main difference is that it allows a 

higher flow of transactions per second, which in turn results in lower fees. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the

33. “So -called stablecoins” are VAs that indicate that they maintain a stable value in relation 

to one or more reference assets (which may be fi at currencies, other virtual assets, securities, 

commodities, or real estate assets). The term does not respond to a legal or regulatory classification 

but is generally used as an advertising term. Depending on the design of the VA in question, it may 

be c lassified as a currency or as a “financial asset” (such as securities) in accordance with the 

standards set by the FATF. 

Related to technologies associated to virtual assets 

34. VA or cryptocurrency address ( e.g., Bitcoin address): It is an alphanumeric code that 

identifies the virtual location associated with a certain amount of VAs, necessary to be able to 

send or receive cryptocurrencies. It works like a bank account in the traditional financial system to 

receive or send transfers . For example, Bitcoin addresses are between 26 and 32 characters long. 

They start with the number 1 for  standard addresses  and number 3 for  multi -signature addresses .

Other cryptocurrencies have their own systems for representing their addresses. VA addresses 

can also be represented by means of QR codes. 

35. QR codes: They are a graphical representation c reated by a graphical  hash  algorithm, 

meaning that it always provides the same graph if the same information is entered. When used in 

connection with cryptocurrencies, it allows the Bitco in address to be shared more easily, since the 

code can be scanned using a smartphone camera. 

36. Blockchain: It is a form of registry or “ledger” used by Bitcoin and most cryptocurrencies 

and works by chaining together blocks of data. Each of these blocks contains information about 

the transaction being carried out. The initial and final elements of the block are related, 

respectively, to the previous and next block. Thus, modification of the block would corrupt the 

entire chain, although it is practically impossible to alter it. In addition, blockchain -based 

technology works in a distributed fashion, with multiple computers operating simultaneously with 

the chain, which makes it extremely diff icult to compromise it through a computer attack. Each 

cryptocurrency has its own Blockchain. 

37. Distributed ledger technology (DLT): It is a data structure that is geographically distributed, 

so that the information in the database is processed simultaneou sly by multiple servers, without 

the existence of a main administrator. It is essentially a database managed by a group of 

participants, each of whom has a copy of the registry, so that any variations are easy to detect, 

since updates to the database can o nly be made by consensus of all the participants. 

38. Public/private key set: The main cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, are built on the basis 

of asymmetric cryptography technology, which uses a public/private key set. The former can be 

known by anyone, the latter is confidential. In the Bitcoin ecosystem, the public key is derived Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets
> 22

from the private key through a one -way cryptographic function known as “Elliptic curve 

multiplication.” 

39. Private key: It is a random number that functions as a secret key, genera ted through an 

asymmetric cryptographic process, and is used to safeguard the ownership and management of 

cryptocurrencies. During the process of creating a VA wallet, first the private key is generated and 

then, from it, the public key, which is mathemati cally related to the former. The process, however, 

is impossible to realize in reverse (deducting the private key from the public one), providing a high 

level of security. The private key is the one that assigns to the holder the control of the funds 

assoc iated with a given VA address. 

40. Public key: It is an identifier that can be shared to enable the transfer of VAs to third 

parties. It is one of the two parts of the set of keys created by asymmetric cryptography to share 

secrets securely. 

41. Cryptocurrency wallets: They are software applications that allow interacting with the VA 

Blockchain in order to generate and/or store cryptocurrency addresses and their corresponding 

public/private key sets. It is an interface that allows users to manage, transfer or receive VAs. 

There are several types of VA wallets. 

42. Hosted / Custodial wallets: These are virtual wallets that are hosted on an external server 

(i.e., in “the cloud”), and are offered through VA wallet service providers. The name refers to the 

fact that the private keys are not held by VA holders, but “in custody” of the service provider. 

43. Hybrid wallets: These are hosted wallets, but not “in custody,” since, although they are 

hosted on the servers of a service provider, the user retains co ntrol over the private key(s). 

44. Self -custody/ Self -hosted wallets: These are the wallets that cryptocurrency users 

themselves keep in their possession, for their own use of the VAs associated with the addresses 

stored in them. These wallets may be virtual or hardware wallets. 

45. Software wallets: These are downloadable desktop or mobile applications that can be kept 

on a desktop computer or on a mobile device (smartphone) to enable secure storage of keys on 

the device. 

46. Hardware wallets: They are wallet app lications hosted on physical devices such as pen 

drives or USB, which allow the user to store his/her keys offline, on portable physical devices such 

as pen drives. 

47. Paper wallets: These are sheets of paper or other material on which the cryptocurrency 

add resses, and the set of public/private keys used to manage the exchange of Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets
> 23

cryptocurrencies are printed, either in plaintext format or in the form of a QR code, by means of a 

VA wallet program. They are used for the storage and safekeeping of funds that wil l not be used 

or moved for a long time, since they offer a higher level of security, as they are not susceptible to 

cyber theft. 

48. Cold storage: It refers to wallets that are not connected to the Internet, such as hardware 

or paper wallets. The purpose of “cold storage” variants is to provide protection against hacking 

or theft of cryptocurrencies. 

49. Hot storage: In contrast to the previous one, this refers to VA wallets that operate online, 

i.e., with an Internet connection. As a result, this form of storage is more vulnerable to 

hacking/theft than cold storage. 

50. Multi -signature wallets: These are applications th at provide an additional level of security 

by requiring the use of multiple private keys to authorize a transaction, thereby reducing the risk 

of cryptocurrency theft if a single private key is compromised. 

51. State -controlled wallets: This is a wallet (of any kind) that is under the control of a 

government authority (it can be a state agency specialized in handling seized assets, a law 

enforcement agency, a prosecutor’s office, a jurisdictional body or even a private company 

collaborating with the state), t o which VAs that are seized or confiscated are transferred. 

52. “Seed words” or “Seed phrase”: They are used by many VA wallet applications to generate 

private keys from a single “seed,” which takes the form of a mnemonic consisting of a sequence of 

between 12 and 24 words in different languages (English, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Chinese, 

French, and Italian), which function as a backup for the wallet, allowing that in case of loss of 

control over the wallet (for example, due to theft, loss or technical malfunction of the device in 

which it is stored), it is possible to recreate it by entering the words in the order originally provided 

in the corresponding application. 

53. A Mnemonic is, in computer science, a word or phrase that substitutes an operation code 

(machine language), thus making programming easier. 

54. Massively multiplayer online role -play ing games (MMORPGs): They are video games that 

allow thousands of players to enter simultaneously into a virtual world through the Internet and 

interact with each other. 

Related to players in the virtual asset ecosystem 

55. User: It is the person or entity th at obtains a VA and uses it to purchase physical or virtual 

goods or services, or to transfer them to another person, or to hold it as an investment. VAs can Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets
> 24

be obtained in several ways. Namely: (1) by acquiring them in exchange for fiat currency (either o n

a VA exchange platform or, in the case of centralized assets, directly from the administrator or 

issuer); (2) by carrying out tasks that are rewarded through payments in VAs; and/or (3) in the case 

of decentralized VAs —such as Bitcoin —by self -generating units of the cryptocurrency through 

participation in the “mining” process. 

56. Miner: A person or entity that intervenes in the decentralized network of a cryptocurrency 

using special software to solve complex algorithms within the “proof -of -work” system use d by the 

system to validate transactions. 

57. Administrator: The person or entity commercially engaged in the issuance (putting into 

circulation) of centralized VAs, who is also responsible for setting the rules of use and maintaining 

the central payment regi stry, as well as holding the authority to withdraw the assets in question 

from circulation. 

58. Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs): As defined by the FATF, comprises any natural or 

legal person not covered elsewhere under the Recommendations who, as a b usiness, carries out 

one or more of the following activities or transactions for/on behalf of another natural or legal 

person: 

i. Exchange between virtual assets and fiat currency. 

ii. Exchange between one or more forms of VAs. 

iii. Transfer of VAs. 

iv. Custody or administration of VAs or instruments that allow controlling VAs; and 

v. Participation in, and provision of financial services in connection with an issuer’s 

offering or sale of a VA. 

59. VA/cryptocurrency exchange platforms (cryptocurrency exchanges) : These are those 

operated by persons or entities commercially engaged in the exchange of cryptocurrencies for fiat 

currency, funds, precious metals, or other cryptocurrencies (or vice versa), in exchange for a fee 

(commission). They generally accept a wid e variety of payment methods (cash, wire transfers, 

credit cards or other cryptocurrencies) and are used to deposit or withdraw funds from VA 

accounts. 

60. Cryptocurrency wallet service providers: Also covered by the FATF definition of VASPs, 

these are perso ns or entities that offer as a service the provision of wallets (either hosted “in 

custody” or hybrid). When “custodial” wallets are offered, this type of provider facilitates 

participation in the VA ecosystem by simplifying the performance of transactions for users. They 

are responsible for maintaining the customers’ balance and usually also offer security with respect 

to cryptocurrency storage and transactions. In that direction, they can provide services such as Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets
> 25

encryption, back up or “cold storage” of t he wallets, protection through multiple signatures or 

mixers. 

61. Mixers: These are platforms that offer cryptocurrency users the possibility of obscuring 

the transaction chain in the Blockchain through the use of anonymity software tools that link 

multiple transactions to a single VA address and send them together in a way that makes them 

appear to come from a different address. The mixer or tumbler intervenes when it receives an 

instruction from the customer to send funds to a certain address. In order to c onceal the origin 

and destination of the transaction, the mixer combines it with a complex and semi -random series 

of fictitious transactions, so as to prevent the transfer to the final destination from being 

associated with the address of origin. Examples of mixers are Bitmixer.io, SharedCoin, 

Blockchain.info, Bitcoin Laundry, Bitlaunder, Easycoin. 

62. Trading platforms: They function as marketplaces, connecting buyers and sellers by 

offering them a platform where they can make and receive offers for their cry ptocurrencies. 

Transactions between users of these platforms are carried out on a “peer -to -peer” basis, i.e., 

without intermediation by the platform. They are not included in the FATF definition of VASP. 

63. Peer -to -peer systems (P2P) are communication or file exchange systems (including 

cryptocurrencies) in which all or some aspects operate without customers or fixed servers as 

intermediaries, but through a series of nodes that behave as equals (“peers”) among themselves. 

64. Local Exchange Trading System (LETS): It is a locally implemented economic organization 

that allows members to exchange goods and services with others in the group. LETS use a locally 

created currency to denominate units of value that can be traded or exchanged for goods or 

services. Theoretically, bitcoins could be adopted as a local currency used within a LETS. Examples: 

Ithica Dollars or Mazacoin. 

Related to anonymity or anti -forensic tools 

65. Anonymizers or anonymity programs/tools: These are software tools an d/or services, 

such as darknets or mixers, which have been designed to hide the origin of a VA transaction and/or 

to facilitate the anonymity of Internet users. 

66. Anti -forensic tools: These are computer tools that have been designed or may be exploited 

to prevent or hinder the execution of investigative measures by law enforcement agencies or state 

authorities. 

67. Dark wallets: These are virtual wallets that function as browser extensions (available in 

Chrome and potentially Firefox) for the purpose of ensuring the anonymity of cryptocurrency 

transactions by incorporating the following functions: self -anonymizer (mixer), decentr alized Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the

trading, “crowdfunding” platforms, securities platforms, and information and access to online 

markets on the “dark web.” 

68. Chain hopping: A method used to hinder the traceability of VA transactions, which consists 

of “hopping” from one cryptocurrenc y to another (and, consequently, from one Blockchain to 

another) using different VA exchange platforms. 

69. Atomic swaps: These are a variant of “chain hopping” through digital smart contracts, 

which make it possible to exchange one cryptocurrency for another without resorting to 

centralized intermediaries, such as VA exchange platforms. They are carried out between 

currencies operating with different blockchains, and can be concluded “off -chain,” i.e.: outside the 

Blockchain of each cryptocurrency. The contra ct requires both parties to confirm reception of the 

funds within a predetermined period of time by means of a cryptographic hash function. If within 

the established period one of the parties does not confirm the transaction, the transaction is 

voided, and the funds are not exchanged. 

70. CoinJoin or Coin Mixing: It is an anonymization technique that takes the form of a digital 

smart contract where the parties agree to commit their VAs in a new transaction, where each one 

ends up with the same amount of crypto currencies it entered with, but in which the addresses 

used are intermingled to make traceability difficult. 

71. Ring signature: It is a method of anonymization that consists in the use of a group digital 

signature modality, according to which each member of the group has its own key, but when using 

it, it is impossible to know which of all of them was used to confirm a certain VA transaction. 

72. TOR (The Onion Router): It is a distributed network of computers on the Internet that is 

used to conceal the true I P addresses (and therefore the true identity) of users by routing 

communications through multiple nodes (randomly chosen for each communication) around the 

world and shielding the data packets indicating the origin and destination of the communication in 

several layers of encryption. 

73. IP (Internet Protocol) address: It is a unique code that identifies a given computer 

connected to the Internet to the rest of the computers with which it is connected. IP addresses 

are assigned by the user’s Internet Service P rovider (ISP), which assigns users certain blocks of 

addresses corresponding to the geographical region where they are located. No two computers 

connected to the Internet can have the same IP address at the same time. 

74. Dark web (Dark net): The area of th e Internet occupied by online content that can only be 

accessed using specialized anonymization software such as TOR. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets
> 27

75. Hidden services: These are web pages located on the “dark web,” which can only be 

accessed through the use of anonymous communication sys tems such as TOR. This prevents their 

true location (IP address) from being identified, since they are masked by the “layered” routing 

provided by TOR. Communication between these sites and their users takes place through a 

“rendezvous point” that provides an additional layer of protection against traffic analysis. 

76. Virtual private network (VPN) is a  computer network  technology that allows a secure 

extension of the  local area network  (LAN ) over a public or uncontrolled network such as  the 

Internet . It allows the computer on the network to send and receive data over shared or public 

networks as if it were a private network with all the functionality, security, and management 

pol icies of a private network. This is accomplished by establishing a virtual end -to -end connection 

through the use of dedicated connections, data encryption or a combination of both methods. Like 

the TOR system, VPNs hide users’ real IP addresses, assigning them random IP addresses to 

connect to their destination sites. 

77. Encryption: It is a data encryption method that consists of encoding the contents using a 

mathematical formula or algorithm that disorganizes them, so that if the corresponding key (called 

a “cryptographic key”) is not available, they look like a set of alphanumeric characters with no 

meaning or reading logic. 

78. “Strong” encryption is that which uses cryptographic keys sufficiently complex to make it 

mathematically impossible for them to be de ciphered by a “brute force” attack. This is achieved, in 

computer terms, by adding bits to the cryptographic keys to make them more complex, which 

exponentially increases the difficulty of decryption by testing each of the possibilities. Thus, adding 

a sin gle bit to the cryptographic key minimally increases the work required to encrypt the data, 

but doubles the computational effort needed to attack the algorithm. As an example, a 128 -bit key 

contains 2 128 (340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 ) possible keys, while a 

256 -bit key contains 2 256 , i.e., a number with twice as many digits as the previous one. Therefore, 

a successful computer attack on cryptographic keys of 128 or more bits is unfeasible. 

79. “Brute force” attack: An attack in which gr eat computational power is used to crack a 

password by trying all possible combinations. 

80. End -to -end encryption is an encryption mechanism in which the message with its contents 

is encrypted on the sender’s device by means of its own key, randomly generated for that 

communication. This key accompanies the message in transit and reaches the recipient’s device, 

being decrypted at that moment only for the persons involved in that conversation. 

81. “Perfect forward secrecy”: It is a cryptographic key management protocol that ensures 

that session keys cannot be compromised even if the server’s private key is compromised. T his is 

done by generating a unique key for each session initiated by the user (as opposed to Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets
> 28

older encryption systems, in which all sessions were encrypted with a single key that, if 

compromised, granted full access). It is the system used to protect commu nications in the main 

Internet messaging services, such as WhatsApp or Telegram. 

82. PGP (Pretty Good Privacy): It is an encryption software based on the Open PGP protocol 

designed to provide privacy, security, and authentication for online communication sys tems. 

Originally created to protect e-mail messages, its use has been extended to also include digital 

signatures, full disk encryption, and network protection. PGP works with a public key (password) 

and a private key (password). The public key or session key is used to encrypt the plaintext 

information to be protected, and the private key is used to decrypt it. To this end, the receiver of 

the message provides a public key (randomly generated for each PGP communication session) to 

the sender, who uses it t o encrypt the data. Then, once both the message text and the session key 

have been transmitted in encrypted form, the receiver uses its private key to decrypt the session 

key, which is then used to return the text to plaintext format. 

83. Voice over IP/VoIP: It brings together different applications to transmit audio information 

in real time over the Internet like the human voice, emulating traditional telephone service. 

However, unlike the traditional Public Switched Telephone Network system, communi cations 

using VoIP systems are “peer -to -peer,” without intermediaries, which prevents the interception of 

communications through the systems usually used. In addition, the data packets containing the 

communications are generally protected by encryption whi le they are “in transit” over the Internet. 

84. Public Telephone Switched Network (PTSN): A network in which all telephone calls are 

established through a central switch that directs the outgoing call to its intended destination (the 

telephone of the receive r of the call, identified by its line number). 

85. Full -Disk Encryption (FDE) is the process by which the entire hard disk of a computer 

(including the operating system) is encrypted, allowing access to the data contained therein only 

after successful authent ication (by entering the corresponding password) in the FDE product. This 

implies that no person without the password (including the companies that manufacture the FDE 

product) can access the information contained in the device. There are FDE products for personal 

computers, laptops, and storage devices (TrueCrypt, BitLocker and PGP, among others). In 

addition, smartphones from the world’s leading technology companies (Apple and Google) are 

protected by FDE, making it impossible to access without a numeric or biometric password to open 

the phone.

86. Blockchain analysis: It is the process of inspection, identification, segmentation, and 

modeling for the visual representation of the public data contained in the Blockc hain, in order to 

obtain useful information about those who carry out transactions with cryptocurrencies. This Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets

analysis is usually carried out by private companies that use proprietary algorithms to map the 

transactions carried out by cryptocurrency users and link them to each other. 

87. Dusting attack: It consists of sending traces of cryptocurrencies (called “dust”) to 

thousands (sometimes hundreds of thousands) of addresses, in order to monitor their activity and 

deanonymize their true holders. Cryptocurre ncy traces can be found on most public blockchains, 

including Bitcoin, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Dogecoin, among others. 

88. Open -Source Intelligence (OSINT): A term that refers to the systematic collection, 

processing, and analysis of open access informat ion. That is: information available to the general 

public without restrictions (on social networks, websites, search engines, news portals, public 

records, etc.). 

89. APIs (Application programming interfaces): A set of requirements that govern the way 

applic ations communicate with each other, for which a part of the internal functions of a given 

program is “exposed” in a limited way. This allows applications to share data with each other and 

perform actions for each other’s benefit without having to share the entire software code. APIs 

achieve this by limiting external access to only a specific set of functions, usually those related to 

requests for different types of information. 

90. Spyware: It is a type of malware (malicious program) designed to operate surrep titiously 

within a computer system and secretly record information. It can monitor and copy what is typed 

(“keylogger”), what enters or leaves the system, capture stored information, or even activate the 

computer’s microphones or cameras. 

91. Vulnerability: A flaw or weakness in the code of a computer system that can be 

manipulated by an attacker to expose all or part of the system. 

92. Exploit: It is the method (computer code) used to gain unauthorized access to a vulnerable 

system. Exploits can be programs, or simply a set of commands or actions designed to “exploit” a 

system vulnerability. 

93. Spear phishing: A method of gaining surreptitious acc ess to a computer system based on 

the deception of legitimate users of the system through “social engineering” techniques, such as 

the creation of an email or SMS message that appears to come from a source trusted by the target, 

containing a “call to actio n” (a required act, which may consist of connecting to a link or opening 

an attachment). 

94. Social engineering: The term refers to the practice of obtaining confidential  information  or 

the performance of a certain action through the manipulation of legitimate  users . It consists of the 

use of deception to obtain the delivery of relevant information, access or  privileges  in Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the

information systems , enabling the attacker to carry out an act that harms or exposes the targeted 

person  or  organization .

95. Watering hole attack: An attack in which the attacker takes control of a server or a web 

page and manipulates it in such a way as to download spyware into the system of the users who 

access it or carry out some kind of action wh ile they are connected. 

96. Supply chain attack: An attack in which weak points in an organization’s supply chain are 

exploited, increasing the chances of success by taking advantage of the trust of the organization’s 

members in the products originating in t hat chain. An example of this attack consists of introducing 

spyware in software updates, so that they are installed and executed by the organization’s 

customers on the basis of a relationship of trust with the issuing entity. 

97. Packet sniffers: These are programs for network monitoring purposes, specifically 

designed to identify, within the Internet traffic flowing through an interception point, data packets 

that comply with different parameters set by the user. 

Related to electronic or digital evidence 

98. Electronic (or digital) evidence: Information generated, stored, or transmitted by means of 

electronic devices that may be used as evidence in court. 

99. Content evidence: Evidence concerning the substance of a communication, i.e., the part 

that represents w hat the sender wishes to communicate to the receiver of the communication. 

100. Wrapper, data -related or “non -content” evidence: It comprises all the information related 

to the communication, except for the content. For example, the date and time of the 

commu nication, its duration, the telephone numbers or IP addresses of the persons involved, the 

cellular telephone cells involved in the communication, etc. 

101. Evidence in transit: This is digital evidence that is captured in real time while it is moving 

through the network. It may be content evidence, wrapper evidence, or both. 

102. Stored evidence: Evidence that, at the time of collection, is not in motion but stored on a 

server (internal or external). Like the previous one, it can be content evidence, wrapper evi dence, 

or both. 

103. Location evidence: It refers to the location of a given communication device at a given time 

and, consequently, also of the person who was using it at that time. It is not content evidence. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets

104. Metadata: This is “data about data.” It is not information created by the user (“active data”) 

but information about the information: date of creation of the documents, author, changes made, 

data about the system or equipment they were created with transmission dat a, etc., which can 

generally be accessed only by operating digitally (i.e., it does not appear by default on the screens). 

105. Cloud storage (or cloud computing): It is the service offered by certain companies that 

allows the user to store digital information on external servers owned by the service provider. It 

comprises three broad categories of services: (i) “infrastructure as a service” (IaaS), (ii) “software as 

a service” (SaaS) and (iii) “platform as a service” (PaaS). The first refers to the provision o f

“machines” (servers) over the Internet, the second to the provision of software applications via the 

Internet, and the third to the provision of a complete network (including servers, operating 

systems, and storage space). 

106. Cryptographic hash: It is a ma thematical algorithm that creates, from an input, an 

alphanumeric output of normally fixed length that represents a summary of all the information 

given to it and that can only be recreated with the same data. This ensures that the file has not 

been modifi ed, since any change in the information, however small, completely alters the “hash,” 

making it impossible to find other information resulting in the same alphanumeric value. 

107. Forensic image: This is a bitstream copy of the contents of a file, hard disk, or server to 

enable computer forensic analysis without altering the original. This copy or “image” differs from 

traditional copies, such as those made when transferring computer files from one folder to another 

or from one computer to another, in that it d uplicates every bit of the original, making it an exact 

clone of the original. If a forensic disk image is made, the duplication includes all the files, the 

empty spaces, the “master file table,” and the metadata in exactly the same order as in the origina l. 

# IV. RELEVANT ASPECTS RELATED TO THE INVESTIGATION, SEIZURE, 

# AND CONFISCATION OF VIRTUAL ASSETS 

A. Money laundering and terrorist financing through virtual assets 

108. The use of virtual assets for money laundering (crypto -laundering) is a natural consequence 

of the emergence of online markets for illegal goods and services (drugs, weapons, computer 

viruses, hacking services, etc.) in the so -called “Dark Web” or “Darknet .” That is: the sector of the 

Internet that can only be accessed with technological tools that allow anonymous surfing, such as 

the TOR system. This criminal phenomenon, in turn, is a consequence of the emergence of Bitcoin 

in 2009, which made it possible for these “dark markets” to operate by offering a means of 

payment that is, in principle, also anonymous. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets

32 

109. The emergence of the first of these markets (Silk Road) in early 2011 marked the beginning 

of a new era in the trade of illicit goods and services. Despite being shut down fairly quickly by the 

authorities, it was immediately replaced by other similar markets. Since then, “dark markets” have 

proliferated on the Web, and today they are the source of a high percentage of the illicit funds 

recycled throu gh VAs and the services associated with them. In this regard, a study that analyzed 

Bitcoin transactions between 2013 and 2016 31 concluded that almost all of the bitcoins of illicit 

origin laundered through cryptocurrency exchange platforms came from dark web marketplaces. 

110. However, VAs are also used to legitimize funds originating from both cybercrime per se 

(Ransomware , computer fraud, scams such as the recent “Plus Token” pyramid scheme in China, 32 

etc.) and from illicit acts committed in the physical w orld, such as bribery. Most of the criminal 

schemes involving VAs are not necessarily novel, but variants of traditional schemes carried out 

by taking advantage of technological advances. 33 

111. The “crypto -laundering” process involves the same three stages a s traditional money 

laundering (placement, layering, and integration). However, the maneuvers associated with each 

of these stages have their own characteristics, as a result of the nature of the VA involved. Thus, 

for example, the need for a placement sta ge depends on whether the illicit funds are obtained in 

fiat currency or directly in cryptocurrencies. This is so, since in the first case it is necessary to carry 

out a conversion from one currency to another, while in the second case it is not. 

112. In the event that the placement stage is required, it is usually necessary to resort to a 

VASP —usually a cryptocurrency exchange platform —to convert the fiat currency into bitcoins or 

other similar VA. This circumstance can be exploited by the authorities in char ge of AML/CFT or 

by State investigative agencies to obtain information on persons attempting to carry out a ML/TF 

scheme with VAs. Hence, especially since the update of the FATF 40 Recommendations in 2019, 

many countries have adjusted their domestic regula tions to the new FATF Recommendation 15, 

and now require VASPs to carry out CDD on their customers and report suspicious transactions. 

113. To circumvent this obstacle, launderers may resort to methods used to achieve the same 

purposes with respect to traditional financial institutions, such as structuring of funds or the use 

of front men. Another approach is to arrange the placement through a VASP located in a 

jurisdiction where they are not subject to AML/CFT duties or are not in compliance with the 

obligations in force. Taking advantage of the transnational nature of the Internet, some VASPs

have explored ways to provide services to customer s in certain jurisdictions without registering in 

those jurisdictions, in order to avoid compliance with AML/CFT obligations, as illustrated in the 

following case: 34 

114. However, the conversion of large volumes of illicit funds into VAs can be problematic. The 

cryptocurrency market is still relatively small, so a massive purchase may cause suspicion. As was 

evident in the case of the illicit proceeds of the Plus Token scam , a massive sale or purchase of 

cryptocurrencies tends to generate sudden price changes in such assets, which may attract the 

attention of the authorities. In any case, and due to the preponderance of this cryptocurrency, it 

is likely that a high volume of transactions will go unnoticed in the Bitcoin Blockchain, while 

transfers for high amounts will surely be conspicuous in those of less used currencies. 

115. Once the placement phase has been completed, there are multiple ways to carry out the 

layering of funds. On the one hand, it can take the form of a series of transactions between VA 

wallets controlled by different persons or even by a single person, since cryptocurrencies allow 

users to maintain an indefinite number of addresses. This circumstance, together with the 

simplicity of creating new addresses, the dissociation between these and real -world identities, the 

speed with which transfers are completed (f aster than those carried out in the correspondent 

banking network) and the ease with which they cross national and regulatory borders, makes it 

possible to create extremely complex layering patterns. 

116. These characteristics of VAs are not only useful for crypto -laundering but can also be 

exploited for terrorist financing. Thus, the ease with which fiat currency can be converted into 

cryptocurrencies and then transferred across borders quickly and with a relatively high level of 

anonymity has resulted in so me terrorist organizations resorting to these methods to obtain funds

Case 1: BitMex. VA exchange platform in violation of AML/CFT regulations: 

In October 2020, the U.S. State Department prosecuted four executives of VA exchange platform BitMex 

for violations of U.S. anti -money laundering regulations. 

Despite serving at least 85,000 customers in the U.S. and running most of its financial infrastructure from 

the U.S., BitMex never registered with U.S. authorities. BitMex’s primary parent was the firm HDR Global 

Trading Ltd., incorporated in a tax haven (the Seychelles), where it never operated or had any employees. 

The platform was owned by a series of shell companies (HDR Global Trading Ltd., 100x Holdings, ABS 

Global Trading, Shine Effort and HDR Services) controlled by the same individuals. The CEO himself 

claimed legal domicile in the Seychelles, but owned part of BitMex shares through a Delaware -registere d

LLC, which held bank accounts in financial institutions in the US. 

BitMex was accused of being an unregistered financial entity, providing services to customers in the U.S. 

despite declaring that its system is designed to exclude them, as well as of viol ations of AML/CFT 

regulations, including the deletion of critical information about its customers. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the

by receiving anonymous “donations” in VAs. Likewise, this kind of assets can also be used to 

acquire weapons or other items in the virtual marketplaces of the Dark Web. 

117. VASPs play an e ssential role in crypto -laundering schemes, either in the placement phase 

(for the conversion of fiat currency into VA), during the layering phase (e.g., allowing the exchange 

of one cryptocurrency for another or providing “mixing” services) or in the fina l stage, where the 

beneficiaries of the scheme convert the funds back to fiat currency. 35 This has led to the 

emergence of VAs exchange platforms specifically created and structured to facilitate crypto -

laundering. 36 In this context, a recent report conclu des that one third of the volume of cross -border 

Bitcoin traffic is being diverted to VASPs with deficient AML/CFT policies. 37 

118. Among the main services that VASPs can offer to assist launderers of illicit funds are 

cryptocurrency “mixing” services. So -cal led “mixers” or “tumblers” function as independent money 

laundering services, combining the inflows and outflows of funds from different users to make 

them indistinguishable from each other. In such a context, passing through a “mixer” replaces the 

transfe r of VAs between two addresses (e.g. Bitcoin), so that the illicit funds that one person 

intends to transfer to another are intermingled with those coming from many other VA addresses 

before finally being sent to the recipient’s, hindering the identificati on of the address of origin and 

the accounts associated with the illicit funds. 38 This is illustrated in the graph below: 39

Refer to: CipherTrace: “Cryptocurrency crime and anti -money laundering report,” February 202 1, p. 6. While the report itself reports 

a sharp drop in the overall percentage of bitcoins channeled to high -risk VASPs, this is primarily due to the rapid increase of interest in 

bitcoins as an investment vehicle, which has led to an estimated 57% declin e in the proportion of bitcoins of illicit origin between 2019 

and 2020. This is largely due to the huge increase in the value of bitcoins, which at the time of their launch were valued at less than a 

penny on the dollar each, while in February 2021 they r eached a global value of $200 billion (refer to: FANUSIE , Yaya J. / ROBINSON ,

Graph 1: Operation of a Mixer: 

119. The basic concept of mixe rs resembles that of investment funds, in which multiple 

individuals accumulate their funds to obtain a collective benefit. The difference is that, in the case 

of mixers, the pooled fund is used to effect multiple cryptocurrency transactions, and the benef it 

is to achieve a greater degree of anonymity by preventing the linking of transfers to specific VA 

addresses. 

120. ML/TF mixers generally charge a fee for their services, do not keep records of their users, 

and can obscure their infrastructure by operating as “hidden services” of the TOR system. From 

the LEAs’ point of view, the use of mixing services by persons under investigation makes it very 

difficult to reconstruct the chain of transactions (unless that person concentrates a significant 

amount of the fu nds processed through the mixer or random or semi -random methods are not 

used to combine users’ VAs). 40

36 

121. Mixers occupy an important place in the market of illicitly sourced VAs, to such an extent 

that some hidden markets of the dark web have an integrated mixer to facilitate the laundering of 

funds from the purchase and sale of illegal goods and services. Hence, despite representing only a 

small percentage of Bitcoin traffic to and from VASPs, mixers are much more likely to be used for 

crypto -laundering. 41 Some of the most widely used mixers overtly advertised the possibility of 

using these services to “clean” “dirty coins,” as illustrated below: 42 

Graph 2: Explanation of the operation of the “Helix” mixer: 

122. Use of VASPs also facilitates the realization of other VA layering methodologies, such as 

“chainhopping,” which consists of exchanging different cryptocurrenc ies with each other, in order 

to cut the chain of transactions in the respective blockchains, a maneuver that —according to some 

studies —has become one of the preferred methods for crypto -laundering. 43 

B. The importance of imposing AML/CFT duties on VASPs for the prevention and investigation 

of ML/TF maneuvers involving VAs 

123. In view of the above, the imposition of information and reporting duties to VASPs is a 

central element of any AML/CFT strategy related to VAs that aims to be effective. At the same 

time, it constitutes a fundamental tool for the development of asset investigations on ML/TF

played by VASPs as intermediaries between the physical and virtua l world, i.e., between the VAs 

and fiat currencies. 

124. In this regard, the new FATF Recommendation 15 provides that member countries should 

adapt their domestic regulations to extend the AML/CFT, registration, and reporting rules 

applicable to financial or non -financial service providers to VASPs, understood as natural or legal 

persons who commercially carry out one or more of the following operations for the benefit of 

another legal or natural person: (i) exchange between VAs and fiat currencies; (ii) excha nge 

between one or more classes of VAs; (iii) transfer of VAs (understood as the movement of such 

assets from one virtual address or account to another); (iv) custody and/or administration of VAs 

or instruments that allow the control thereof; and (v) parti cipation in or provision of financial 

services linked to the offer and/or sale of VAs by users. 

125. Therefore, the main players in the VA ecosystem, such as cryptocurrency exchange 

platforms and VA transfer services; some VA wallet providers (such as those that host wallets or 

maintain custody or control over the VAs of another natural or legal person, their wallets and/or 

their private keys); and providers of financial services linked to the issuance, offer or sale of VAs; 

among other possible busines s models, are included within the definition. 44 

126. The importance of these actors lies in the fact that they serve as the main entry point into 

the global financial system for criminals seeking to convert funds obtained or held in the form of 

VAs into fiat c urrency. In this regard, it is important to keep in mind that while it is true that some 

businesses in many countries support payment with cryptocurrencies for the purchase of goods 

and services, most goods are still paid for with fiat currency. Therefore, it is most likely that profits 

earned or recycled in cyberspace (through VAs) will eventually be transferred to the real world and 

converted into fiat currency, so that the holder can enjoy them or reinvest them in their illegal 

business (e.g., acquiring items that can only be paid for with physical currency). 

127. In this scenario, the links between the physical and virtual worlds constitute the main focal 

point of asset investigations related to transactions with VAs, since it is there where transactions 

pe rpetrated in cyberspace —in a context of (pseudo) anonymity —can be connected with one or 

more real persons. The same is true in the opposite direction, if criminals intend to resort to the 

use of cryptocurrencies for the placement or layering of funds obtai ned in fiat currency, in which 

case VASPs will be the entry point into the VA ecosystem. 

128. It is clear that if VASPs are obliged to require the full range of information aimed at 

identifying their customers and establishing the origin of the funds they ope rate with, the recourse 

to VAs will lose some of its attractiveness compared to fiat currency. In turn, AML/CFT regulation   

> 44 Refer to: FATF: “Virtual assets and virtual assets service providers. Guidance for a ris k-based approach,” June 2019, p. 14 § 35. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the

38 

provides supervisory agencies and LEAs with an important starting point for the identification and 

prosecution of money launderers an d other criminals. 45 

129. The most important entrance or exit point to and from the VA ecosystem are the 

cryptocurrency exchange platforms (“exchanges”), which present different forms and business 

models. Their primary function is to allow their customers to buy or sell VAs in exchange for fiat 

currency, other VAs, or other tradable goods or securities, in exchange for a fee, commission, or 

other form of remuneration. They generally accept a wide variety of payment methods, including 

cash, bank transfers, cred it or debit card payments, or even other VAs. 46 

130. There are two main types of cryptocurrency exchange platforms: centralized or 

decentralized. In the first case, VAs are transferred “through” the platform, which acts as an 

intermediary. That is, it is part of the transaction, buying VAs from the seller and selling them to 

the buyer. On some of these centralized platforms, users first deposit fiat currency or 

cryptocurrencies into custodial accounts, which are then used to fund the transactions. 

Decentralize d platforms, on the other hand, only provide a venue for buyers and sellers to meet 

to conduct exchanges, which are done exclusively in a P2P format. 47 Although most platforms are 

centralized, this makes them vulnerable to hacking, which is why there is a trend in the VA 

community to replace them with the decentralized variant. 48 

131. Unlike centralized platforms, which are included in the FATF definition of VASP (which 

indicates that they must be subject to the CDD and reporting obligations established in the 

AML/CFT regulations, according to the new Recommendation 15 of said organization), P2P 

platforms, in principle, are not. 49 This, since it is understood that, for the time being, the use of the 

latter type of platforms has not been generalized to the point of constituting a relevant ML/TF 

risk. 

132. Another channel for the exchange between VA and fiat currency is using the so -called VA 

ATMs or “kiosks.” These are machines similar to ATMs, located in many cities around the world, 

which provide a phys ical point where people can buy or sell cryptocurrencies. In the absence of 

effective regulation and oversight, VA ATMs can become a vulnerability in the AML/CFT system; 

and, in fact, there are already reports indicating that operators of this class of ATM s tend to be

less compliant than other VASPs with the CDD and reporting obligations set out in the regulations. 

In turn, VA ATMs have been linked to illicit activities, having been used by drug traffickers, credit 

card fraud or prostitution networks and un registered P2P exchange platforms. 50 This was the route 

used in the case detailed below: 51 

C. Diagnosis of the regional situation regarding the regulation of VAs and VASPs 

133. As noted above, for the development of an effective AML/CFT strategy with respect to 

the potential illegal use of VAs, it is essential that there is consistent regulation, at the global level, 

with respect to both such assets and VASPs. Conversely, the absence of consistent regulation is 

one of the main reasons why VAs are vulnerable to exploitation for illicit purposes. For this reason, 

the FATF has noted that the effective ness of the 2019 revised standards to prevent ML/TF with 

VAs depends on their effective implementation by all jurisdictions, as well as on compliance with 

the obligations imposed on private sector entities by these standards. 52 

134. In this context, after the update of the 40 Recommendations, the above -mentioned 

organization carried out an annual global review of the implementation of the revised standards 

by the different jurisdictions and the private sector. As a result, the FATF co ncluded that, in 

general, both the public and private sectors have made progress in implementing the revised 

standards. It noted that 35 of the 54 jurisdictions assessed reported having implemented the 

standards, with 32 of them regulating VASPs’ activity and the remaining 3 prohibiting it. 53 

135. With specific regard to Latin America, prior to the update of the 40 FATF 

Recommendations and the subsequent evaluation by the FATF, the OAS Group of Experts for the 

Control of Money Laundering carried out, between 2 017 and 2018, a survey of the situation in

Case 2: Operation Glutons. Use of Bitcoin ATMs for ML. 

Spain’s Guardia Civil reported through Europol the frequent use of Bitcoin ATMs operated by a company 

under investigation by a criminal organization with a background in drug trafficking to convert illicit 

proceeds into VAs. In order to circumvent AML/CFT controls, the persons in charge of making the 

deposits applied “smurfing” (structuring) techniques, dividing the funds into batches of less than EUR 

1,000. In a single day, they made multiple deposits in different VA ATMs in different locations, for total 

amounts of approximately EUR 200,000 per month. 

The suspicion of the Spanish authorities was that there was complicity with the illegal operation on the 

part of the company managing the VA ATMs, since no CDD tasks were carried out and no STRs were 

filed regarding the aforementioned scheme. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the

40 

terms of VAs at the regional level. 54 In such context, it was possible to establish that the situation 

at that time presented the following characteristics: 

• Lack of regulation regarding the operation of VAs. 

• La ck of convictions for illegal acts perpetrated with/involving VAs. 

• Incipient research strategies, only at FIU level. 

• Identification of virtual currency supply portals in almost all the countries consulted, with 

most of them indicating the circulation of m ore than one cryptocurrency. 

• Existence of a considerable sector of the economy accepting virtual currencies (especially 

Bitcoin) as a means of payment. 

• Absence of minimum user standards and AML/CFT regulation referring VAs and VASPs. 

136. With regard to convi ctions or investigations, the OAS noted that there had been only one 

investigation into the illicit use of VAs in the region (the “Liberty Reserve” case in Costa Rica). 

Furthermore, with regard to the seizure or confiscation of this type of asset, the surv ey found no 

experience in this area, nor any type of regulation for the seizure, confiscation, or administration 

of VAs. 55 

137. In addition, it is important to note that as regards the evaluation of Recommendation 15 

based on the FATF amendments, as of the da te of this report, no GAFILAT country has been 

evaluated in this regard, so that the results can be seen either in countries not yet evaluated in the 

4th Round of Mutual Evaluations, or in future follow -up reports and other rounds of evaluation. 

138. Moreover , for the purposes of preparing this guide, a questionnaire was sent to the RRAG 

focal points requesting information —among other questions —on whether the ML/TF risks 

associated with VAs were recognized at the local level, whether there was local legislatio n

regulating their use, and whether AML/CFT standards had been introduced in relation to VASPs, 

in compliance with the new FATF Recommendation 15. 

139. In this context, 15 of the 17 countries in the region (88%) considered the use of VAs as a 

potential source of ML/TF risk. 

140. However, the identification of the possible illicit use of VAs as a vulnerability in terms of 

ML/TF has not resulted, so far, in the general adoption of local rules regulating the market for VAs 

The responses to the questionnaire show that only 4 of the 17 GAFILAT countries have legislated 

on this issue (24%).

41 

141. Finally, with regard to the introduction of regulations aimed at addressing the actions of 

VASPs —in line with the new FATF Recommendation 15 —, it is noted that, of the 11 countries that 

responded to this question, 6 have addressed VASPs (55%), while the remaining 5 have not yet 

done so. 

142. In this regard, there has been progress in the recognition of the use of VAs as a potential 

source of ML/TF risks, which —while not leading to a generic regu lation of the cryptocurrency 

market in most countries —did result in most of them updating their local regulations on AML/CFT 

to include VASPs. 

143. Given the importance of adequate regulation of the performance of VASPs —both for the 

purposes of preventing AML/ CFT and as a source of information for law enforcement agencies in 

the framework of ML/TF investigations of assets involving VAs —it is essential that the process of 

implementation of the new FATF standards continues to progress in Latin America, in order t o

achieve a homogeneous regulatory framework throughout the region. 

D. Challenges inherent to the investigation of ML/TF with VAs 

144. The emergence of VAs as an element to develop new ML/TF typologies implies the 

transfer of a significant portion of the inves tigations related to such maneuvers —as well as the 

measures aimed at the seizure and confiscation of funds —to cyberspace, a completely different 

scenario from the setting in which they have traditionally been carried out. This forces the national 

authoriti es in charge of ML/TF prosecution in general, and of investigation, identification, seizure, 

and confiscation of VAs in particular, to face new obstacles and challenges and, in turn, to resort 

to new strategies and methodologies in order to remain effectiv e. 

145. In terms of obstacles and challenges, the following stand out: the “extra -territorial” nature 

attributed to cyberspace by many experts; the freedom and speed of exchange of computer data 

(including those that may be relevant as evidence or to identify VAs susceptible to seizure or 

confiscation) through the Internet; the phenomenon of “loss of knowledge of the location” of such 

data 56 and the consequent difficulty in establishing the procedural law that should govern their 

collection. In addition, ther e is the emergence of new technologies that prevent —or at least hinder 

to a great extent —the exercise by police agencies of the surveillance powers conferred upon them 

by local laws, among which we should mention —in addition to those related to the operati on of 

VAs —the new methods of communication that replace the Public Switched Telephone Network

42 

(PSTN), 57 the anonymous navigation systems on the Internet, and the encryption of 

communications and stored contents, among others. 

146. The problem related to the determination of the regulations applicable to the 

implementation of investigative measures restricting rights or tending to seize VAs in view of the 

transnational nature of such assets is particularly relevant with regard to decentralized VAs. This 

is due to the fact that in the case of centralized VAs (for example, virtual currencies issued in the 

field of “Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games” or MMORPGs), since there is a central 

administrative authority that controls the management of the ass ets, unless expressly provided 

otherwise, the regulations applicable in the jurisdiction in which such authority is based shall apply. 

147. In the case of decentralized assets such as cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, there is —

by design —no central authorit y controlling the flow of VAs. The currencies themselves are nothing 

more than digital information (specifically, the record of transfers between users of the 

cryptocurrency in question). Their location for the purposes of the applicable jurisdiction for a n

eventual seizure or confiscation is the one corresponding to the place where the wallet in which 

such information is stored is located. However, this location may be fixed (in the case of a fixed 

wallet) or it may not be fixed, as in the case of an onlin e wallet, especially if it is “in the cloud,” in 

which case the information is usually stored in servers located in data centers located in strategic 

points of the globe. In addition, electronic data may be in a single location or distributed (in 

sections) across multiple servers (even in different countries), and automatically rearranged 

depending on the availability and demand for cloud storage space at any given time. They may also 

be stored redundantly, in multiple copies, so that they can be recovered even if one server (or data 

center) fails. 

148. Consequently, in some cases it may not be possible for the company providing the cloud 

storage service itself —and, therefore, for national authorities seeking to seize or confiscate VAs —

to establish precisely wh ere a specific set of digital data, for example, a Bitcoin wallet, is located 

at any given time. As a consequence, it is also impossible to establish which country has jurisdiction 

to order the seizure or confiscation of cryptocurrencies. 

149. This problem is addressed by the concept of “loss of location” coined in a Council of Europe 

document, 58 which in turn occurs within the framework of a more general phenomenon, namely 

delocalization as an essential feature of the Internet or, more specifically, of cyberspace. This, 

insofar as it is a field that is not located in a specific place, but, in a functional sense, is in all of 

them at the same time, but in a physical sense, in none. These characteristics clash with the

43 

upholding of the principle of ter ritoriality as the focal point of the exercise of sovereignty by 

countries through the application of procedural rules within the scope of their jurisdiction, insofar 

as they question the possibility of establishing where the objects which the rules refer to are 

located. This is because the speed and unpredictability of electronic information flows make it 

difficult (or impossible) to locate the data at any given time. 59 

150. Technological evolution also entails another series of consequences arising from the 

emergence of technological developments that can be exploited by cybercriminals (whether, for 

the purposes of this guide, ML or TF) to evade the action of the authorities or hinder their efforts. 

In turn, the parallel emergence of sophisticated surveillance or forensic tools has turned the pursuit 

of cybercrime into a veritable arms race between criminals and investigative agencies, each 

seeking to exploit technological advances to prevail. 

151. In this context, one of the main areas of conflict is around “anon ymity by design” 

technologies, which are one of the most important features of decentralized virtual currencies 

such as Bitcoin, which have been created with the specific aim of guaranteeing their users at least 

some degree of anonymity. In this sense, the first feature tending to achieve this goal is precisely 

the decentralized structure, lacking a central authority that can be subject to state supervision and 

know the true identities of the users. To this end, cryptocurrencies are organized as P2P exchang e

systems, in which interactions are carried out directly between two users, without intermediaries. 

152. Notwithstanding the above, the different cryptocurrencies also implement a series of 

additional technological developments aimed at increasing the anonym ity of the users. Thus, based 

on how they are structured, these VAs can offer four different levels of anonymity, namely: 1) 

pseudo -anonymity: derived from the use of pseudonyms (alphanumeric addresses) to obscure the 

user’s identity; 2) partial anonymity (“Set anonymity”), where the identity of the real user can be 

one among several possible ones, which is achieved through the use of “ring signatures”; 3) total 

anonymity of the user, which is obtained when the real user can be any of the nodes in the syst em; 

and 4) confidential transactions, in which the amounts transferred are also guaranteed to remain 

concealed. 

153. Both Bitcoin and most altcoins operate at the first level, in which the addresses involved 

in the transactions (and the amounts transferred) ar e public, but the identity of the users involved 

is protected using pseudonyms (the alphanumeric keys that identify the addresses). Consequently, 

while it is not difficult to follow value flows within the system, understanding how this reflects the 

actual value transfers between individuals is more complicated. However, the emergence of 

technological tools that facilitate the latter, weakening the anonymity offered by Bitcoin and other 

traditional cryptocurrencies, has led to the creation of alterna tive currencies —called “privacy

44 

coins” —that include features aimed at ensuring a higher level of anonymity for users. The most 

important of these currencies are Dash, Zcash, and Monero. 

154. The most important characteristic of private coins is that, like Bit coin, although they 

operate from an open -source public Blockchain, they do not make the same data visible. Namely: 

• Dash (DASH), launched in 2014, uses a type of “Coinjoin” mixer known as “PrivateSend” to 

reduce the traceability of coins on its Blockchain. 

• Zcash (ZEC), created in 2016, is based on the use of a novel variety of cryptography known 

as “zero -knowledge proof,” which allows users to reach a consensus on the validity of the 

information (necessary to avoid the emergence of apocryphal transactions) while keeping 

the data encrypted. This ensures the legitimacy of the Zcash network transfers and at the 

same time safeguards the true identity of the participants. 

• Monero (XBR) also launched in 2014, does not publish information about the sender, 

receiver, or value of transactions on its Blockchain. Instead, it uses “stealth addresses,” 

created specifically for one -time use to ensure that only the user(s) involved in the 

transaction have access to the transaction data. It also employs a form of cryptography 

known as “ring signature;” which allows transactions to be confirmed within a group of 

users in such a way that an observer is not able to identify the specific person who 

confirmed a particular transfer. 60 

155. One of the main differences between Monero, Das h, and Zcash is that, in the latter, 

applications aimed at increasing anonymity are optional, while in the former it is enabled by 

default. Consequently, the use of the advanced anonymity variant of Dash or Zcash is reduced to 

a minority. 61 Moreover, being derivations of the Bitcoin Blockchain, both Zcash and Dash retain 

some vulnerabilities (in terms of anonymity protection) similar to those of the former. 

156. In comparison, cryptocurrencies using the Cryptonote protocol (such as Monero) offer a 

higher level of privacy. By using this protocol, the traceability of transactions is obfuscated by 

avoiding the identification of the true balance resulting from a trans fer (known as “unspent 

transaction output” or TXO), replacing it with a set of possible TXOs that includes the real one 

together with other “fillers,” known as “mixins.” 

157. Partly due to this, Monero has been positioning itself, since its launch in 2014, as the main 

alternative to Bitcoin from the point of view of transaction (un)traceability. In that regard, it 

received a big boost when it was accepted as a payment currency by the (now defunct) AlphaBay 

Dark Web marketplace in August 2016, when the number of transactions registered on the

Monero Blockchain increased by 80%. 62 Currently, one of the most important hidden markets of 

the Dark Web (White House Market) only accepts this currency to pay for products and services 

traded there. 

158. At present, h owever, the presence of “private currencies” in ML/TF investigations is 

minimal, although their growing acceptance by the main VASPs and in markets of the Dark Web 

seem to indicate that their use is set to increase in the future. 63 In any case, Bitcoin con tinues to 

be the most widely accepted currency in most virtual markets, as reflected in information from the 

Dark Web Observatory (DWO) on the use of cryptocurrencies in the main virtual markets of the 

Dark Web. 64

According to the DWO survey, the most widely used cryptocurrencies are Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ethereum (ETH), 

Litecoin (LTC), Monero (XBR or BitMonero), and Zcash (ZEC). Refer to: Silfversten, Erik / Favaro, Marina / Slapakova, Linda / Ishikawa,

46 

159. According to the data collected by the DWO, Bitcoin, Monero, and Ethereum monopolize 

exchanges on the Dark Web mar ketplaces (98%). Although Monero has a significant presence 

(27%), displacing Ethereum (12%), the predominance of Bitcoin in transactions is clearly 

maintained (59%). In contrast, the use of other “private currencies” is minimal, with Zcash 

registering jus t 1%. 

160. The persistence of Bitcoin as the dominant cryptocurrency in this area would seem to 

contradict the idea that criminal activity is turning en masse to “private currencies” in order to 

exploit their advantages in terms of obscuring transaction -relat ed information. This could be due 

to the fact that Bitcoin has reached a “critical mass” in the licit and illicit cryptocurrency markets, 

which increases the likelihood that Bitcoin transactions will go unnoticed in the overall volume of 

transactions. 

161. Another factor in favor of the continued dominance of Bitcoin is the greater ease of access 

to them on cryptocurrency exchange platforms (including those located in jurisdictions with few 

AML/CFT controls). In contrast, private currencies remain relatively difficult to obtain and have 

less liquidity, which may force them to be sought on platforms with higher transaction volumes, 

where —in turn —it is more likely that AML/CFT measures have been implemented. Therefore, at 

least for the time being, private curre ncies do not seem to be suitable for the laundering of illicit 

funds on a large scale but are rather restricted to the use of a minority portion of the criminal 

element, as a currency of exchange for small -scale drug trafficking or other crimes. 65 They may be 

considered suitable for terrorist financing involving small volumes of funds. 

162. Moreover, the anonymity that is not obtained through the use of private currencies can be 

achieved through other methods or tools, such as the use of mixers, decentralized exchange 

platforms or applications, cryptocurrency exchanges through “chain -hopping” or “atomic swaps,” 

or through “dusting” (which consists of transferring traces of cryptocurrencies to multiple random 

addresses, in order to hinder the traceability of the transaction chain). 66 

163. Mixers operate with the main cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin) and can be 

accessed both on the Surface Network and on the Dark web, through the TOR system. While 

there are no limits on the amounts of cryptocurrency tran sactions, there are limits when 

transforming these VAs into fiat currency, an aspect that can reduce the effectiveness of mixers 

for recycling significant volumes of funds of illicit origin. To circumvent these limits and avoid 

drawing attention to themsel ves, launderers may choose to space out outgoing payments over 

time and make them in varying amounts.

164. Decentralized exchange platforms (DEXs) enable direct P2P exchanges between 

cryptocurrency users. These are applications that exploit technological inno vations such as multi -

signature custodial accounts to allow users to exchange VAs without the need for a third -party 

custodian of funds. These include IDEX, Bitsquare, OpenLedger, CryptoBridge, and Bitshares. 

165. The possible uses for technological developme nts based on encryption, to provide a higher 

degree of anonymity, are not limited to the design of cryptocurrencies or in the implementation 

of mechanisms to further hinder to the traceability of the transactions carried out with them. On 

the contrary, enc ryption is, at present, the main element for the protection of digital data 

throughout the global IT ecosystem, both with respect to data that are “in transit” through the 

Internet and those that are stored, including data that are generated by communicati ons or 

necessary for those communications to take place. 

166. In this context, the very environment of the “dark web,” where online markets operate and 

much of the illicit activity with cryptocurrencies takes place, is the result of the emergence of these 

ano nymity tools based on encryption. In particular, the TOR system (“The Onion Router”). It is a 

distributed network of computers on the Internet, where all machines running the TOR software 

(which can be downloaded for free) serve as nodes, allowing all user s of the system to surf 

anonymously, masking their real IP address (and thus their identity) by routing communications 

through random circuits between nodes around the world. In addition, the system covers the 

computer data packets that make up the communi cation (including those indicating origin and 

destination) with multiple layers of encryption, which prevents their traceability. Other methods, 

such as virtual private networks (VPNs) or the I2P network, operate with similar mechanics. 

167. The TOR system ma kes it possible to host web pages on the “dark web” whose true IP 

address cannot be identified —called “Hidden services” —making it difficult to determine the 

geographical jurisdiction they are operating from. For the same purposes, other cryptocurrency 

exch ange platforms operating on the superficial Web choose to use intermediaries to register their 

Internet domains or use DNS records that suppress or conceal the identity of the real domain 

holders. 67 Most illicitly sourced VAs are recycled through exchange platforms or mixers located in 

unknown jurisdictions. 68 

168. In addition, in the last ten years, the use of “strong” encryption (i.e., with cryptographic 

keys of 128 bits or higher) to protect the content of Internet communications has been 

consolidated. The massive adoption of these technologies by the main global technology 

companies has created new opportunities for online criminals and, in turn, new challenges for 

police and investigative agencies.

169. Thus, administrators and sellers in the first illicit online marketplaces protected their 

communications with “Pretty Good Privacy” (PGP) encryption software, which was later also 

adopted by more technically sophisticated criminals or criminal organizations. The TOR system 

also makes it possibl e to encrypt e-mails. Criminals have also begun to use means of 

communication that make interception more difficult, such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) 

systems, like Skype. Subsequently, some companies have developed encrypted telephone 

communicat ion systems specifically designed to avoid state monitoring, which were quickly 

adopted by criminal organizations around the world. In 2020 and 2021, two of these systems 

(EncroChat and Sky ECC) were the subject of highly sophisticated undercover operation s by law 

enforcement agencies in Europe. The same happened in 2021 with another similar system (An0M), 

in this case by the FBI in the USA. 

170. In many of its variants, encryption is used in such a way that access to the content of 

communications is not only beyond the technical reach of the authorities (regardless of whether 

they have judicial authorization to obtain it), but also of the companies that implemented the 

technology. Such is the case of the most globally widespread messaging systems (Whats App, 

Facebook Messenger, Telegram, Signal), in which communications in transit are protected by an 

“end -to -end” encryption system that automatically generates by default a unique random key for 

each communication, which only the sender and the receiver possess. This prevents any third party 

outside the communication (including the company that developed the application) from being 

able to decrypt it in order to access its contents. 

171. In addition, applications that use encryption to protect digital information sto red on 

computer equipment (whether desktop computers, laptops, external servers, or storage units such 

as pen drives or removable hard disks) have also emerged. These applications allow both specific 

files and the entire disk to be encrypted with virtually invulnerable “strong encryption” protocols. 

Given the growing trend to replace paper documents with digital documents (including, of course, 

those that may be useful as evidence in ML/TF proceedings), the emergence of technologies that 

make it impossible for legally authorized authorities to access these documents poses a

considerable challenge. 

172. The availability of cheap or even free strong encryption tools (such as TrueKrypt, BitLocker 

or PGP) offers criminals with minimal computer skills the possibility of protecting their confidential 

information behind an insurmountable barrier. The problem this creates for investigative agencies 

has been getting worse from 2014 onwards, since the implementation by two of the major 

technology companies (Appl e and Google) of full -disk encryption of computers containing 

operating systems developed by these firms, using private keys generated from the password Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets

49 

generated by each user of the device (which means that the company does not have this key and 

therefore cannot decrypt the contents of the disk). 69 

E. Technological developments that favor the investigation of ML/TF activities with virtual 

assets 

173. Crimes that, as is the case with ML/TF with VAs, are committed to a large extent in 

cyberspace (i.e., so -call ed cybercrimes), therefore have special characteristics that distinguish 

them from crimes committed in the physical world. This, in turn, means that the investigation of 

such unlawful conduct requires the use of strategies, methods, techniques, and tools t hat are 

suited to the environment in which the investigation takes place (cyberspace) and to the type of 

evidence that must be obtained to prove the commission of the crime and the responsibility of the 

accused (electronic or digital evidence). 

174. In this r egard, it has been pointed out that the existence of procedural instruments that 

support the use of investigative techniques and tools suitable for the investigation of crimes 

committed in cyberspace is an essential requirement for the LEA to be effective in the fight against 

cybercrime. Consequently, countries without adequate legislation run the risk that their authorities 

will not be able to provide answers to citizens affected by cybercrime. 70 In this regard, 

organizations such as Interpol and Europol e mphasize that the adoption of new technologies in 

the field of VA investigations is crucial to assist in the effectiveness of such investigations and 

increase the confiscation of funds of illicit origin. Therefore, they recommend the research and 

developme nt of technological tools that facilitate the prevention and investigation of ML/TF 

conducts involving VAs. 71 In Latin America, the OAS has urged those states that have not yet done 

so to adopt or update, as soon as possible, the legislation and procedural measures necessary to 

ensure the collection and safekeeping of all forms of electronic evidence and its admissibility in 

criminal proceedings and trials. 72 

175. In this scenario, since the dawn of the new millennium, international instruments dedicated 

to the problem of cybercrime have begun to appear, starting with the Council of Europe 

Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest Convention), which, since its entry into force in 2001, has 

become the most relevant multilateral instrument on the subject at the global le vel. Subsequently, 

at the regional level, other documents have appeared on this issue, including the Caribbean 

Community Model Legislative Texts (ITU/CARICOM/CTU Model Legislative Texts), the Draft 

African Union Convention, the Commonwealth Model Law, the Draft Directive of the Economic         

> 69 Refer to: International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP): “Data, privacy and public safety. A law enforcement perspecti ve on the

Community of Eastern Africa (ECOWAS Draft Directive), and the League of Arab States 

Convention. 

176. Although there are some nuances among them, all these multilateral instruments coincide 

in pointing out that, in order to comba t cybercrime more effectively, not only do countries need 

to criminalize the main cybercrimes, but it is also necessary to incorporate into the procedural 

regulations of the signatory countries provisions that legitimize the use of techniques and methods 

of investigation and evidence gathering appropriate to the problem of cybercrime. Among these, 

the following are worth mentioning: 

• Production orders: These are orders issued by a judge or competent authority to require 

Internet service providers or other I CT -related companies to hand over relevant computer 

evidence in their possession or to which they have access in accordance with the law in 

force. 

• Preservation orders: Orders issued by a competent authority, for the purpose of requiring 

Internet service p roviders or other ICT -related companies to preserve, for a certain period 

of time, information or digital evidence that is at risk of being altered or destroyed, in order 

to allow the legal steps necessary for its collection to be complied with. 

• Mandatory cooperation of Internet service providers or other ICT -related companies: It 

refers to cases where it is necessary to provide technical assistance to the competent state 

authorities for the collection of computer evidence. This cooperation may include the 

obligation to keep the measures carried out in such context secret. 

• Search of computer systems or equipment: This consists of the possibility for a magistrate 

to order the search of a system or device that may contain important digital evidence or 

informa tion, in order to extract or copy it. 

• Extended access: This consists of the possibility of remotely recording evidence or 

electronic information contained in another computer system or equipment accessible 

from and through the computer system being searc hed ‘in situ’ , in order to extract or copy 

it. Generally, it is required for extended access to be considered legitimate that the state 

authority knows (or has reason to believe) that the second system or equipment is located 

within the same country in whi ch the first search is carried out. 

• Obtaining electronic communications traffic data: This consists of the possibility that a 

judge or competent authority may order the monitoring of electronic communications by 

law enforcement agencies (either with the cooperation of telecommunications companies 

or by their own technical means), in order to obtain “wrapper” data (i.e., data that does not 

include the content of the communications). 

• Interception of electronic communications content data: This consists of the possibility 

that a judge may order the interception of electronic communications, ei ther with the 

cooperation of the telecommunications companies or by its own technical means. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets

51 

• International cooperation: The need to establish provisions that would allow countries to 

collaborate with each other to obtain digital evidence through productio n or preservation 

orders is mentioned. It also highlights the importance of implementing mechanisms to 

expedite the exchange of information, adapting it to the characteristics of digital evidence. 

177. In this scenario, it is important to bear in mind that tec hnological evolution not only favors 

criminals who seek to exploit its developments to facilitate the commission of crimes or hinder 

their investigation but may also offer advantages and innovative tools to the LEAs, which have the 

possibility of resortin g to investigative techniques linked to new technologies to pursue (for 

example) possible ML/TF activities with VAs. 

178. Thus, as far as the subject matter of this guide is concerned, it has been pointed out that 

the use of cryptocurrencies not only facilita tes illicit exchange on the Internet, but also its 

detection, due to the public nature of the respective blockchains. Indeed, although Bitcoin and 

other similar currencies are commonly used to perpetrate crimes, some authors understand that, 

in fact, their use favors the investigation of illicit flows of funds. 73 

179. Both Bitcoin and most Altcoins do not offer true anonymity, but “pseudo -anonymity.” This 

is because, although the identity of the users is protected under a pseudonym in the form of the 

alphanumeric sequence that constitutes their address, the data referring to the transactions they 

carry out (dates, amounts, balance and addresses of the counterparties) are recorded in a public 

registry (the corresponding Blockchain). This is inherent to the “distributed ledger technology” 

(DLT) on which the operation of cryptocurrencies is based, 74 by virtue of which the legitimacy of 

transactions —in the absence of a central authority to validate them —is given by their cryptographic 

record in blocks t hat make up a chain (the “Blockchain”). This, in turn, forms an unalterable 

sequential record of all transactions made with the cryptocurrency in question. 

180. In this scenario, the public nature of the Blockchain allows the information contained 

therein to be mined for years in search of clues to determine the identity of the users. This has 

given rise to the so -called “Chain analysis” (in reference to the Blockchain), a term that 

encompasses a series of techniques based on the use of computer tools to rever se the anonymity 

of cryptocurrency users. The origin of these techniques —developed by private companies 

dedicated to assisting research agencies and other private entities in the identification of actors in 

the Blockchain —dates back to academic studies con ducted since 2011, which demonstrated the 

limits of the pseudo -anonymity offered by Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. 75

52 

181. One of the main methods of deanonymization consists of determining the identity of the 

holders of certain addresses through the use o f statistical tools that, based on the analysis of 

information contained in the Blockchain, link them to known addresses (for example, 

cryptocurrency exchange platforms, online marketplaces or persons already identified) or to 

pseudonyms published online. That is: data generated by exchange networks between users with 

proven links to illicit activities is exploited to reconstruct the complete chain of transfers between 

them and their customers or contacts. In order to identify relevant VAs addresses within the 

cryptocurrency ecosystem, investigators can also make payments with their own VAs to different 

services (exchange platforms, gambling sites, online wallets, etc.), or search the Internet for 

published VA addresses. 

182. Chain analysis tools also take adva ntage of vulnerabilities intrinsic to the Blockchain 

network (such as the filtering of IP addresses and time stamps associated with each published 

transaction) to deanonymize users. And this is regardless of the specific Blockchain application 

they are usi ng, and even when they resort to anonymity tools such as TOR. In this direction, 

academic works point out that it is possible to take advantage of a countermeasure built into the 

Bitcoin system to repel DDoS attacks, so as to prevent users from hiding thro ugh the use of TOR. 76 

The method known as “dusting attack” can also be used, which consists of sending traces of 

cryptocurrencies (known as “dust”) to thousands (or hundreds of thousands) of wallets and then 

analyzing their subsequent movements in search o f clues as to the identity of their holders. 

183. When large VAs transactions take place, tracing the movements of those involved through 

chain analysis methods is easier, which is important because the Bitcoin ecosystem and the main 

cryptocurrencies do not o ffer a high degree of anonymity for major money laundering transactions. 

The traceability of transactions is even greater if there is access to a central service, such as a 

VASP.

184. The increasing transparency of the Bitcoin Blockchain and the main Altcoins has led to the 

emergence of so -called “private currencies,” such as Monero or Zcash. However, academic studies 

have shown that also users of private currencies can be de -anonymized with a higher degree of 

accuracy than expected, 77 exploiting specific feat ures of the functioning of such VAs. 

185. In the case of Monero, advantage is taken of the way in which “filler coins” (called “Mixins”) 

are created and used to obfuscate the identification of those that are actually exchanged. As far 

as Zcash is concerned, an analysis of the operation of this cryptocurrency found that only 3.5% of 

the operations carried out with it involve the increased anonymity variant offered by the system, 

and of those, up to 31.5% of the movements can be reconstructed using a dvanced analytical tools. 

This means that, in practice, 98% of Zcash transactions are subject to traceability. 78 

186. The availability of software tools designed to exploit the characteristics of cryptocurrencies 

to enable the deanonymization of their users i s not, however, the only product of the technological 

evolution of the last two decades that favors state surveillance. On the contrary, the shift of 

modern societies towards the massive, widespread and constant use of ICTs for the realization of 

virtually all human activities (whether institutional, commercial, informational, educational, 

academic, recreational, and, of course, also criminal), whose main consequence is the generation 

of a huge amount of data linked to these activities, which can be “mined” by LEAs for investigative 

purposes, can also be exploited for this purpose. The exploitation of this accumulation of data is 

favored by the fact that such data, being digital, is generated, cross -referenced and stored much 

more easily. Especially since th e emergence of the tools that make up the phenomenon known as 

“Big data,” specifically designed to allow the analysis of huge volumes of information. 

187. Another fundamental feature of the new technological reality that can be exploited for the 

purposes of s tate “computer surveillance” is that the prevailing business model of the main 

technology companies —especially around the Internet —is based on the exploitation of user -

generated data. Consequently, in practice, the companies themselves have generated, for 

commercial reasons, a veritable “surveillance superstructure” of unprecedented proportions, the 

results of which can be accessed by state agencies by requesting the cooperation of private 

parties, as recommended by the international instruments mentioned a bove. 

188. In such a context, LEAs are in a position to access three main categories of information on 

citizens. Namely: 

a. Information on communications and movements collected by telecommunications 

companies (including both those generated constantly, as a r esult of communication

54 

between smartphones and cell phone towers, and those generated by GPS devices inserted 

in most of these devices and collected by applications that are enabled to “know the 

location” of users ). 

b. Data stored and processed by Internet co mpanies (including that derived from search 

histories in Internet search engines, data, and metadata generated by interaction in social 

networks, data on purchases or browsing in online marketplaces, and information on Web 

browsing collected by cookies on Web pages); and 

c. The information generated by the devices comprising the so -called “Internet of Things” 

(IoT). 

189. In addition, the advent of the digital era has resulted in a significant increase in the capacity 

of traditional state surveillance techniques, as a result of the availability of technological tools such 

as digital cameras (including those installed in closed circuit systems on public roads, infrared 

cameras or those placed in unmanned aircraft —“drones,” —GPS devices, digital spy microphones, 

cell phone cell simulator equipment, and technologies for interception and analysis of Internet 

traffic, among others). 

190. The main consequence of these technological advances is that the effectiveness of 

surveillance carried out by the State is no longer limit ed by its magnitude or duration, since the 

decrease in technology and data storage costs has eliminated many of the financial or practical 

drawbacks traditionally involved. Consequently, states have, as never before, the potential to 

conduct simultaneous, invasive, targeted, and large -scale surveillance activities. 79 

191. Finally, two other tools have emerged that are specifically designed to respond to the anti -

forensic defenses employed by modern cybercriminals (including crypto -launderers) by taking 

advanta ge of the very features of the Internet and the computer systems they exploit to carry out 

their illicit activity. Thus, the possibility of surfing the Net anonymously allows “digital undercover 

agents” to operate, while the existence of vulnerabilities in computer programs opens the door to 

state hacking. 

192. The use of digital undercover agents basically consists of taking advantage of anonymity 

tools such as TOR and the widespread use of pseudonyms on the Internet (and especially on the 

dark web) so that i nvestigative agency personnel (designated and authorized in accordance with 

the legislation of each State) can interact online with potential criminals, penetrate organizations 

and obtain evidence that can be used to obtain a conviction. 

193. State hacking involves adapting the “Trojan” or spyware programs used by cybercriminals 

so that they can be used to obtain information or computer evidence remotely (i.e., without making   

> 79 Refer to: United Nations Organisation (UN): “The Right to Privacy in the Digital Age,” Statement A/HRC/27/37, Report of the O ffice

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets

55 

physical contact with the device that stores or generates the data). This has two major advantages 

for investigators: (a) that, unlike physical searches, the remote collection of evidence can be carried 

out surreptitiously, without notifying the person under investigation of the existence of the 

investigation; and (b) that it can be carried out even if the location of the person under 

investigation and/or the location of the device into which the spyware is being introduced is 

unknown. 

194. Furthermore, the use of state spyware has multiple uses. It can be used not only to 

remo tely access stored data, but also to obtain access keys to encrypted documents or those 

stored on external servers, to monitor communications over the Internet, to carry out acoustic or 

audiovisual surveillance, to locate and individualize people who conta ct certain pages (or 

individuals) over the network, or to track subjects under investigation in real time. 

195. The first records of spyware use by state investigation agencies date back to more than 

two decades ago. 80 This tool began to be used in the USA and was later adopted also in other 

countries, such as Italy, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Israel. 81 In some 

countries (Spain, France, England, the Netherlands, Poland), the use of spyware is ex pressly 

regulated in local procedural law, while in others (USA, Australia, Germany, Italy) its use is 

governed by the analogical application of procedural rules relating to traditional investigative 

measures. 82 

196. In turn, two of the international instrume nts on cybercrime mentioned above refer directly 

or indirectly to the possibility of resorting to the use of spyware to obtain data on the content of 

communications. Thus, the Commonwealth Model Law (art. 18.b) mentions the possibility of law 

enforcement a gencies obtaining content data through “the application of technical means;” while 

the Model Legislative Texts of the Caribbean Community (art. 27.1.) refer to the possible use of 

“forensic software” for investigative purposes. 

197. Since the use of spyware b y the State has become widespread, the fact that it can be used 

in a more invasive way than traditional measures —to the extent that it is possible to obtain, by this 

means, all the information contained in a smartphone (beyond the fact that, according to t he 

legislation in force in each country, it is generally the applicable judicial authority who decides the 

extent to which this tool will be used) —has led international organizations such as the United 

Nations to express their concern about the possible im pact on the right to privacy derived from

practices that take advantage of the vulnerability of digital communication technologies for 

electronic surveillance. 83 

198. However, the UN itself has also recognized that since digital communication technologies 

can be, and have been, used by private individuals for criminal purposes (such as recruitment for 

and financing of terrorist attacks), lawful and targeted surveillance of digital communications can 

be a necessary and effective measure for law enforcement agen cies when carried out in 

compliance with international and national law. 84 In the same sense, ENISA and Europol have also 

expressed their views at the European level. 85 

199. In this context, it is generally considered preferable that the use of new forms of e lectronic 

surveillance such as state spyware be expressly regulated, since it is understood that the analogical 

application of existing rules may not be able to compensate for the invasive nature of such an 

investigative tool. 86 However, in the absence of express regulation, where the legislation in force 

authorizes analogical application, it is possible to reduce the risks with respect to the right to 

privacy and ensure proportionality between the restriction to that right and the state purposes by 

adoptin g, at the time of ordering a measure of this type, the prior and subsequent requirements 

established in the rules of the countries that have legislated on the matter. 

200. Such requirements include the need for judicial authorization, the restriction of the us e of 

state hacking to the investigation of serious crimes, the setting of limits on the mode of use, the 

requirement of separate authorizations for each function of the state spyware, the control over 

the operation of the computer tools used, and the destr uction of irrelevant information. It is also 

advisable to establish the obligation to remove the software after its use, to notify the interested 

parties, and to implement mechanisms to supervise the use of spyware, among others.

F. Regional situation wi th respect to the incorporation of new technological investigation 

methods 

201. The relationship between new technologies and the investigation of cybercrime was the 

subject of a global survey conducted by the UNODC in 2013, 87 which highlighted the problems 

and challenges generated by the emergence of technological tools with anti -forensic capabilities. 

These same issues were later pointed out by other organizations linked to police agencies, such as 

the International Associati on of Chiefs of Police (IACP). 88 In contrast, the European Parliament 

carried out another survey, in this case on the use of spyware by the state as a means of 

counteracting the above -mentioned problems, 89 which revealed the growing adoption of this tool 

by the USA, several European countries, Israel, and Australia. 

202. In the questionnaire sent out for the purposes of this guide, the RRAG contact points were 

asked whether the procedural legislation in their respective countries contained rules on the use 

of s oftware tools for remote access to computer systems and/or monitoring of communications, 

as well as on investigation using open -source intelligence techniques (OSINT). Also, whether, if 

not, the existing procedural rules can be used analogically to cover t he use of investigative 

techniques not expressly regulated. 

203. As to whether the procedural legislation covers the use of spyware, a large majority of the 

countries that responded (7 out of 11, 63.6%) did so in the affirmative. It can be seen, however, 

that the answers do not show that the rules cited expressly refer to the use of computer tools (as 

is the case, for example, with the legislation of Spain, France, England or the Netherlands), but 

rather that such use is interpreted as falling within the scope of the rules governing, in a generic 

way, the interception of electronic communications and other measures in which spyware can be 

used, either by establishing that such a measure can be carried out by “any technical means” or 

without saying anything abou t it. In other words, they leave it up to the authority in charge of 

carrying out the measure to choose the technical resources to be used for this purpose.

Graph 4: Regulation of the use of spyware as an investigative tool: 

204. The situation is different with regard to OSINT techniques, since in this case most of the 

countries that responded (7 out of 11, 63.6%) answered that the use of such techniques is not 

regulated. 

Graph 5: Regulation of the use of OSINT techniques: 

205. In any case, the fact that the information obtained through OSINT techniques is —as its 

name indicates — “open source,” determines that the lack of express regulation does not constitute 

an obstacle for the use of this investigative method. 

206. Moreover, th e responses to the questionnaire show that a large majority of the countries 

that replied (7 out of 11, 63.6%) indicated that the local procedural system allows for the analogous 

application of both investigative techniques (spyware and OSINT). Of the rema ining 4, one did not

rule out that such analogical use is feasible but stated that it could not provide a definition on the 

matter because it was left to judicial interpretation. In two of the other three cases, the negative 

response was due to the fact th at the analogical application was not necessary in view of the 

existence of procedural rules that, in the opinion of the reporting authority, support the use of the 

investigative measures in question. 

207. When evaluated as a whole, the responses to the quest ionnaire suggest that there is a 

favorable scenario in the region, in principle, for the implementation of new computer 

investigation techniques in the framework of asset investigations related to cybercrimes in general, 

and ML/TF activities with VAs in pa rticular. 

G. Treatment of digital evidence 

208. A common element in the investigation of ML/TF activities with VAs and the technological 

tools that can be used to carry out such investigations (and even to seek the confiscation of such 

assets), is that in bot h cases, there is digital information generated by ICTs. 

209. ICTs are, in fact, the central element that makes the use of VAs possible, since they operate 

in the virtual environment and all operations related to them involve, at some point or another, the 

us e of computer systems and data. The only “paper” traces, if any, could be found in the records 

generated by VASPs when VAs are exchanged for fiat currency or vice versa. Therefore, most of 

the evidence that will eventually be incorporated into legal procee dings to prove illicit transactions 

with VAs —and certainly the most important —will be almost exclusively in electronic or digital 

format. 90 

210. In this regard, the UNODC points out a series of relevant features of electronic or digital 

evidence, which should be taken into account for the purposes of searching, obtaining, 

maintaining, and analyzing it, and which are of great importance in the context of VA ML/TF 

investigations. 91 Namely: 

• Difficult traceability: It results from the circumstance that it i s found in places where it can 

only be detected by specialists, and through the use of specific tools, which allow not only 

to identify the truly relevant information —separating it from that which is not —but to infer 

it from the interweaving of apparently innocuous data. 

• The need for the intervention of specialists, since, without their participation, the 

information located in the computer systems cannot be extracted in such a way as to      

> 90 Refer to: United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) “Basic manual on the detection and investigation of the laundering of
> crime proceeds using virtual currencies,” June 2014, p. 60.
> 91 Refer to: United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) “B asic manual on the detection and investigation of the laundering of
> crime proceeds using virtual currencies,” June 2014, pp. 61/62. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the
> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets
> 60

guarantee that it is reliable and has not been manipulated or altered in any way. The 

intervention of specialists is also necessary to identify and process related information that 

may be relevant to the investigation. If the investigation is also related to ML/TF schemes, 

the specialization of the experts involved should a lso include knowledge of finance, money 

laundering methodologies and other such matters. 

• High volatility, since the computer systems that create, process, and store digital evidence 

destroy, as part of their routine operation, some of the existing data whe never certain 

events occur, such as automated updates that overwrite old information in order to free 

up space for new information. 

• Susceptibility to alteration. Computer systems or equipment constantly modify the state 

of their memories, either at the us er’s request (when saving, copying or updating 

operations) or automatically (allocation of memory space, temporary storage, scheduled 

updates, etc.). This feature is relevant to understand the inherent temporal limitations of 

computer evidence and to be ab le to manipulate such evidence appropriately from the very 

moment it is identified as relevant to an investigation. 

• Ability to copy unlimitedly. Digital information can be copied indefinitely without losing 

reliability. That is: so that each copy is identi cal to the original. While this may be 

problematic for the differentiation between the original and the copy, once it is established 

that the copies are, in fact, identical to the original, it becomes an advantage, insofar as it 

allows the distribution of exact copies of the relevant evidence to be analyzed 

simultaneously by different experts. 

211. It follows that the treatment of digital evidence requires greater resources (in terms of 

technology and specialized human resources) than physical evidence, since th e intervention of 

untrained agents in operations where this type of evidence may be found may not only result in 

relevant evidence being overlooked, but also in it being accidentally altered or destroyed. Likewise, 

for it to be truly effective in a judicia l process, it must be obtained, safeguarded and analyzed in 

such a way as to guarantee its authenticity, completeness, reliability, and verisimilitude. 

212. The ability to ensure that these standards are met is an essential requirement in relation to 

the computer tools used to obtain electronic evidence, such as state spyware. This is so, since —in 

view of the novel nature of these methods —the question of the r eliability of the information 

retrieved becomes crucial for the operators of the judicial system to be convinced that they 

constitute a legitimate means of incorporating evidence into a criminal proceeding. Therefore, the 

technological tools used must ensu re that it is possible to capture the evidence sought in 

compliance with the aforementioned guidelines. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets
> 61

213. Moreover, the predominant role that electronic evidence —and potentially also the use of 

new technological tools —is acquiring in cybercrime investigati ons in general and ML/TF schemes 

involving cryptocurrencies in particular, requires the development of new knowledge for all those 

involved. This includes both the members of the police agencies or departments of the Public 

Prosecutor’s Office who led the investigations, as well as the magistrates who must authorize the 

adoption of measures or the use of techniques involving ICTs (from the analysis of the Blockchain 

to the use of spyware, including the use of modern surveillance techniques) or weigh the re sulting 

evidence. The reality shows, however, that there is a significant deficit in terms of the training of 

relevant actors in all matters concerning the link between ICTs and criminal investigations, which 

poses a concrete risk to the effectiveness in t he prosecution of ML/TF schemes involving 

cryptocurrencies and the seizure and confiscation of VAs. 

214. In view of this, and for the purpose of providing competent authorities in general and police 

agencies in particular with useful tools to effectively ful fill their functions with regard to the 

collection, custody, processing, and analysis of electronic evidence, a series of protocols containing 

standards or good practices on the subject, developed by bodies or agencies specialized in law 

enforcement or in the use of new technologies, have been emerging around the world. 

215. These include the following: “First Responders Guide Template” of the IOCE; RFC 

3227 of the Internet Engineering Task Force – Internet Society (IETF -ISOC); “Electronic 

Crime Scene Investig ation, a Guide for First Responders” of the Technical Working Group 

on Digital Evidencie (TWGDE); “Electronic Crime Scene Investigation, a Guide for First 

Responders,” “Forensic Examination of Digital Evidence: A Guide for Law Enforcement” 

and “Investigati on Involving the Internet and Computer Networks,” all from the National 

Institute of Justice (NIJ) of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ); “APCO Good Practice 

Guide for Digital Evidence” of the Association of Chief Police Officers (APCO); 

“Identification and Handling of Electronic Evidence” of the European Union Agency for 

Cybersecurity (ENISA); and ISO/IEC 27037:2012 “Information Technology -Security 

Techniques - Guidelines for Identification, Collection, Acquisition and Preservation of 

Digital Evidence.” 

216. In this context, in the questionnaire addressed to the RRAG contact points for the purpose 

of preparing this guide, the countries were first consulted on the application of protocols that 

regulate the treatment of computer evidence. Of the countries that responded to the 

questionnaire, a large majority (13 out of 16, 81%) responded that they have their own protocols 

regulating the actions of the security forces in the collection of computer evidence and/or the 

seizure of computer devices. 

217. It is worth mentioning, however, that of the three countries that responded negatively, one 

(Colombia) reported that despite not having protocols that regulate the activity of security forces Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets

62 

in the collection of digital evidence, local regulations do cont ain protocols on the matter, although 

addressed to the Attorney General’s Office. 

218. From the above it is clear that there is, in general, a high degree of awareness in the region 

of the need for protocols regulating the collection of evidence. Even in thos e cases in which no 

good practice guides have been developed on the matter at the internal level, the above mentioned 

can be taken as a reference, where appropriate. 

219. Moreover, with regard to the existence of specialized cybercrime investigation or 

cybers ecurity units, there is also a substantial majority of positive responses, although not as large 

as in the case of protocols (11 out of 16, 69%). 

220. Likewise, of the seven countries that responded affirmatively, four reported having 

specialized units of the Public Prosecutor’s Office, with a fifth reporting that the creation of such 

a prosecutorial unit is currently being planned. 

H. Problem of VAs seizure 

221. Due to the particular characteristics of VAs, their seizure or confiscation may be 

considerably more d ifficult than that of tangible assets such as fiat currency. However, the 

experience gathered since the emergence of Bitcoin to date shows that this can be achieved. This 

was demonstrated by the closure of Silk Road, the first illicit online marketplace to operate with 

VAs as a means of payment, when an extensive FBI asset investigation culminated in the arrest of 

the marketplace’s creator and the seizure of bitcoins valued (at the time) at between 3.5 and 4 

million dollars. 

222. In the following years, there were other confiscations of cryptocurrencies (mostly bitcoins, 

but not exclusively) valued at millions of dollars in Europe, Australia, Japan, and China. The most 

recent were the seizure of VAs subtracted by a hacker from Silk Road accounts and the 

confisc ation of cryptocurrencies originating from the “PlusToken” pyramid scheme by Chinese 

authorities, totaling approximately $4 billion. There were also seizures linked to terrorist financing, 

such as the capture of around 2 million VAs belonging to terrorist groups (including Al -Qaeda, ISIS 

and Hamas) in August 2020. 92 Even “private currencies” were confiscated. In one case, 

approximately 3,691 Zcash were seized that were in the hands of the administrator of the now 

defunct illicit online marketplace AlphaBay (one of the successors of Silk Road), who had been 

arrested in 2017. 93 

223. Also, from the responses received to the questionnaire sent during the development of this 

guide, it appears that European countries that are observers in the RRAG reported cases in w hich

63 

they managed to “block” VAs of a suspect on a cryptocurrency exchange platform (Spain), seize 

VA wallets (Andorra), and transfer VAs belonging to suspects to wallets controlled by state 

authorities (France). 

224. Similarly, at the regional level, a favor able scenario is noticed, from the regulatory point of 

view, for the implementation of seizure and confiscation measures. In this regard, it should be 

noted that from the results of the 4 th Round of Mutual Evaluations on compliance with FATF 

standards, 12 of the 17 GAFILAT countries that have been evaluated, have a degree of compliance 

between mostly compliant and compliant with Recommendations 4 and 38. Under these 

Recommendations, countries are required to establish mechanisms to enable their competent 

au thorities to effectively manage and, when necessary, dispose of frozen, seized or confiscated 

assets. These mechanisms should be applicable both in the context of domestic proceedings and 

pursuant to requests from foreign countries. 94 This is illustrated b elow 95 :

R.38  LC  LC  LC  LC  LC  PC  LC  C C LC  LC  C

225. It should be noted, however, that none of t he regulations outlined in the responses 

received expressly refers to the seizure and/or confiscation of VAs. However, following the reform 

of FATF Recommendation 15 (in order to incorporate the aforementioned assets in AML/CFT 

systems), these Recommendati ons, particularly those relating to international cooperation (R.38), 

should also apply to VAs. 96 

226. Even so, the FATF itself recognizes that many LEAs or prosecutors’ offices lack the 

knowledge and/or resources required to investigate illicit conduct relat ed to VAs. It points out that 

most investigators have not yet encountered such assets in their investigations and face a steep 

learning curve when they do. 97 

227. In this context, the countries of the region are beginning to take the first steps in this 

direction. In fact, from the responses received, 8 of the 16 (50%) countries consulted reported 

having registered ML/TF investigations with VAs.

228. With regard to sei zure or confiscation of VAs, three countries (Argentina, Brazil and Chile) 

reported the adoption of measures to achieve this goal, while another, which also had cases, did 

not provide information on whether or not measures were adopted on the VAs involved. Thus, 

with regard to Argentina, a case was reported in which, after identifying a virtual wallet located on 

a VA exchange platform on behalf of a company involved in the laundering of drug trafficking 

proceeds, the funds were seized for the purpose of con fiscation. For this purpose, the VAs 

contained in the wallet (approx. USD 295,000) were transferred to a wallet controlled by the 

intervening court. In other pending cases, the specialized ML/TF prosecutor’s office suggested the 

adoption of similar measure s in relation to funds in custody of exchange platforms, but so far, the 

seizure of the VAs has not been achieved. 

229. Brazil reported four cases in which the authorities adopted precautionary measures related 

to this type of assets. These are the operations “Faroeste,” “Rekt,” “Faraó,” and “Egipto.” In the first 

case mentioned, the use of cryptocurrencies (especially Bitcoin) as one of the means of payment 

in an alleged scheme for the sale of judgments in a local court was investigated. In the remaining 

three , a considerable amount of VAs was successfully blocked by court orders directed against 

“custodial” wallets held by VASPs. Thus, under “Operation Rekt,” the injunction targeted VAs 

valued at BRL 110 million, allegedly originating from drug sales. In “Oper ation Faraó,” bitcoins 

worth BRL 6.4 million were frozen, linked to a pyramid scheme. While “Operation Egypt” involved 

the freezing of USD 24 million in cryptoassets that were in the custody of a cryptocurrency 

exchange platform registered in the USA, also in connection with an investigation into an alleged 

pyramid scheme. 

230. Finally, Chile reported that in a case investigating drug trafficking and ML offenses, a 

significant amount of cryptocurrencies was seized in a virtual wallet belonging to one of the 

su spects, which were transferred to an account controlled by the Public Prosecutor’s Office for 

safekeeping. 

# V. RECOMMENDATIONS, STEPS TO BE TAKEN, AND CONCLUSIONS 

A. Introduction 

231. The main objective of an asset investigation is to identify and document the movement of 

funds originating from —or linked to —criminal activity. To this end, the links between (i) the origin 

of the funds; (ii) their beneficiaries; and (iii) the times at which the funds are received and the places 

where they are stored, deposited or transferred are valuable sources of information for 

investigations into the underlying criminal activity. 98   

> 98 Refer to: FATF: “Guidance on financial in vestigations involving virtual assets,” June 2019, p. 7 § 1. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the
> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets

65 

232. With regard to ML/TF criminal operations with VAs, it is important to bear in mind that 

beyond the special characteristics of these assets, which make them more vulnerable to 

exploitation for criminal purposes and represent an additional difficulty for investigators, the fact 

is that the way in which such criminal operations are detected and investigated is not different 

from that used in traditiona l cases of ML/TF or illicit behavior of a patrimonial nature. 

233. The patrimonial investigation related to the use of cryptocurrencies can go in two 

directions. On the one hand, it can start from the finding of the existence of criminal activity and 

attempt to trace VAs to its beneficiaries (as occurred in the “Welcome to video” case reviewed 

below, Case § 4). In such a context, ML behaviors with VAs are often identified as the result of an 

investigation concerning criminal activities that involve the intensi ve use of cash, are carried out 

online or are likely to generate significant amounts of illicit proceeds. 99 Among the criminal 

activities that may derive from the use of cryptocurrencies, there may be traditional criminal 

behavior brought to the online wor ld (such as drug trafficking in the Dark Web markets); or 

cybercrime as such, such as ransomware , extortion based on the theft of confidential information, 

or various forms of computer fraud. 

234. On the other hand, the investigation may find as a starting po int certain transactions with 

VAs considered suspicious, either because they were carried out or are connected with persons 

known to be involved in illicit activities, or because they have been identified as suspicious by a 

Financial Information Unit (FIU) or other similar body (e.g., because they resemble those carried 

out by “money mules” or because they are carried out by VASPs known to be involved in the 

provision of ML/TF services, such as “mixers”). 

235. In order to make asset investigations more effective, the authorities responsible for 

conducting them should have at their disposal the widest possible range of information, whether 

from their own sources, from exchanges with other national authorities, or from cooperation with 

third parties ( e.g., in the private sphere). The FATF highlights different categories of information 

relevant to asset investigations. 100 Namely: 

• Criminal records and intelligence information: This refers to information stored by LEAs 

regarding persons under investigation with potential links to criminal activity. In the 

context of VAs, it may include data on suspected illicit activity by such persons on the Dark 

Web; identification of their ps eudonyms or aliases; addresses of known cryptocurrencies 

or accomplices (and their pseudonyms or aliases); prior arrests or convictions; physical or 

electronic addresses, telephone numbers or email addresses that they may have used in 

connection with crimi nal activities. This information may come from proprietary databases

or be obtained by querying databases maintained by law enforcement organizations such 

as Interpol or Europol. 

• Information from AML/CFT controls: Suspicious transaction reports (STRs) ori ginating 

from FIUs generally contain a wealth of information regarding the asset profile and 

activities of the persons under investigation. In investigations linked to the use of VAs, 

STRs originating from VASPs capable of linking their customers with the transactions 

carried out are of special importance. 

• Patrimonial information: This includes all information that may be obtained from 

compliance with the CDD duties of the reporting institutions under the AML/CFT 

regulations. That is: bank accounts, financ ial or commercial records, etc. Regarding the use 

of VAs, it may include records of transactions carried out through VASPs, or of VASPs with 

traditional financial entities, or any other asset activity that may generate suspicions of the 

possible use of VAs to recycle funds of illicit origin. 

• Information from regulators: That is, all information held by supervisory bodies such as 

central banks, tax authorities, stock market, or insurance regulators, etc. 

• Open -source information: It includes all information that can be obtained through open 

sources of unrestricted use, such as the Internet, social media, print or electronic media or 

publicly available records. In the context of ML/TF investigation with VAs, it may comprise 

data such as the price of different cryptocurrencies, contact information or VASPs data, or 

links between the persons under investigation and potential identifying information 

(cryptocurrency addresses, wallets, links to criminal activity or criminals, etc.). At the 

regional level, the RRAG has published a list of open sources from member countries. 101 

236. Likewise, taking into account the close relationship that in many cases ML operations with 

VAs have with cybercrime, valuable information can also be found in the possession of national 

units specialized in cybersecurity, in countries where such units exist. This may include : ( a) reports 

on incidents involving the financial sector; (b) information on malware aimed at identity theft or 

unauthorized collection of confidential and/or financial inf ormation (including data or programs 

used for VA management); and (c) intelligence on the hacker community or on cybersecurity 

threats. 102 

B. Importance of links between VAs and fiat currency 

237. Given that a large part of VA transactions take place in cybersp ace, an essential focal point 

of asset investigations into illicit conduct involving this type of assets lies in the identification of

the links between the physical and virtual worlds, where the exchange between VAs and fiat 

currency takes place. These li nks function both as a “gateway” —when criminals intend to carry out 

crypto -laundering maneuvers for the placement and/or layering of illicit funds obtained in fiat 

currency (converting them into cryptocurrencies) —and as an “exit ramp,” in cases where the 

beneficiary of a crime attempts to withdraw the illicit gain and convert it into traditional money, 

either to spend it or to reinvest it more easily. 

238. This “exit ramp” or “gateway,” from or to the VA ecosystem, is, in practice, the vulnerable 

point of any ML/TF scheme involving these values, especially when significant amounts are 

handled, given that the (relatively) small nature of cryptocurrency markets make them more 

sensitive to massive inflows or outflows of funds, which usually cause sharp rises or fa lls in the 

value of the VAs, which in turn invite scrutiny of the transactions that caused them. 

239. It is also important to bear in mind that VA exchange networks are populated by centralized 

intermediaries, such as exchange platforms and custodial wallet services. Even though 

cryptocurrencies were created to operate with a decentralized structure, and the exchange 

between users within the network is quite simple, converting fiat currency into VAs or vice versa 

can be difficult without the assistance of a th ird party, especially if you are dealing with 

cryptocurrencies for the first time. Exchange platforms emerged to fulfill this role and have 

become so prevalent that they now account for up to 99% of cryptocurrency transactions. 103 A

large part of this volum e is handled by major international platforms such as Binance, Bitstamp, 

Bitfinex, Coinbase, and Kraken. 104 

240. There are also numerous platforms dedicated to VA exchange in Latin America, most of 

which provide services in more than one country in the region: ArgenBTC, Bitex, Ripio, Satoshi 

Tango, Buda.com, Crypto MTK, Coinmama, BitCambio, Flowbtc, Bitcointoyou, Coi nmama, CEX.io, 

Orionx, Obsidiam, Panda.exchange, Coinfield, Bitso, Volabit, Isbit, Bitrus, Cryptobuyer, and 

CritoWay, among others. 

241. This means that, in practice, almost all VA transaction chains are bound to pass, at one time 

or another, through one of t hese intermediaries. Thus, the insertion of this centralized element in 

a naturally decentralized ecosystem generates bottlenecks that can be exploited for greater 

efficiency, both in supervision and in the investigation of criminal conduct involving VAs. Hence, 

the new FATF Recommendation 15 requires that local regulations impose on VASPs the obligation 

to collect, maintain, and share with competent authorities’ information obtained through CDD,

which can be extremely useful for investigative agencies to i dentify persons operating with 

AML/CFT, in addition to being a potentially useful source of evidence on ML/TF schemes. 

242. Given that VASPs constitute the first line of alert regarding ML/TF with VAs —insofar as 

they are in a privileged position to detect pos sible suspicious transactions and report them to the 

respective FIUs —STRs derived from transactions considered suspicious by them constitute one of 

the main sources of information for asset investigations concerning illicit maneuvers with 

decentralized VAs (in particular, cryptocurrencies). 105 

243. In this regard, the list elaborated by the FATF on the main “red flags” of suspicious activity 

with VAs in its June 2020 report should be considered as the main reference on the issue. 106 In 

turn, in a previous report, the FATF highlighted the following as the most relevant red flags: 107 

• Structuring VA transactions to circumvent registration or reporting thresholds (similar to 

the structuring of cash transactions ). 

• Transfer of VAs operat ing on a public and transparent Blockchain (such as Bitcoin) to a 

centralized exchange platform, for immediate conversion into “private currencies” (such as 

Monero, Zcash, or Dash ). 

• Depositing VAs on an exchange platform and subsequent (often immediate) withdrawal, 

without additional exchange activity, which is an unnecessary step that generates the 

payment of transfer fees. 

• Transactions with VA addresses linked to known fraudulent schemes or with markets on 

the Dark Web. 

• Creation of separate accounts under different names to circumvent restrictions on 

operating or withdrawal limits imposed by VASPs. 

• Using money transfer services advertised on P2P platform sites. 

• Making a large initial deposit to initiate a new relationship with a VASP. 

• Transfer of V As from/to wallets whose previous activity indicates the use of mixing 

services. 

• Transactions with VAs originating from or directed to online gambling services.

69 

• Use of multiple credit or debit cards associated with a VA wallet to withdraw significant 

amounts of fiat currency (“cryptocurrencies to plastic”); and 

• Use of “cold” storage wallets to transport VAs across borders. 

244. The information generated by FIUs from data obtained by VASPs (or by traditional financial 

entities, which operate wit h VASPs) in compliance with their AML/CFT obligations is of great 

potential value for asset investigations. Similarly, it can be seen that the STRs submitted by these 

entities upon detection of any of the “red flags” mentioned above contain both informatio n on 

transactions (issuing customer, beneficiary, addresses of the customer’s wallets, balance in the 

wallets, date and time of the transactions, type of VA transferred, location of the transfer, canceled 

transactions, bank accounts registered or verified, and type of devices used); as well as customer 

information (name, user identification, IP address, physical billing address, e -mail address, date of 

birth, nationality, citizenship, economic profile and commercial activity). 108 

245. The role assigned to the V ASPs as the first warning line in the prevention of ML/TF with 

cryptocurrencies and their effectiveness in the global AML/CFT structure depend on their activity 

being regulated in a homogeneous manner at a global level. In such a context and given the ease 

with which VAs can be transferred and services linked to such assets can be offered across borders 

on the Internet, the existence of jurisdictions with weak or non -existent controls with respect to 

VASPs poses a vulnerability to the entire system. 

246. Altho ugh many VA payment platforms or processors seek to operate within the framework 

of legality, there are also others that do not. The latter are favored by the very nature of 

cryptocurrencies, which facilitates the existence of VASPs that operate beyond sta te regulation, 

taking advantage of anonymity tools on the Internet that allow them to hide their true location 

and offer their services to customers around the world. As previously mentioned, these VASPs 

process a significant percentage of illicitly source d VAs. 

247. In this context, investigative agencies should place special emphasis on the activities of 

“mixers” or “tumblers” and online gambling sites, which concentrate a high volume of criminal 

proceeds. Investigations related to the use of VAs should aim n ot only to identify and prosecute 

persons who exploit the use of cryptocurrencies to carry out criminal activities, but also to 

prosecute and eventually stop the activity of VASPs or other service providers when such activity 

is aimed at favoring or facili tating criminal operations. 109 

248. A favorable aspect for the actions of the authorities against VASPs that act illegally is that, 

in general, there is usually a certain concentration in terms of the actors that provide services to     

> 108 Refer to: FATF: “Guidance on financial investigat ions involving virtual assets,” June 2019, p. 19 § 55.

70 

criminals. Thus, a recent s tudy on the activity of mixers and online gambling sites that receive 

funds of illicit origin found that three of these services accounted for 97% of the bitcoins 

originating from recognized criminal activity. 110 

249. Therefore, identifying those responsible f or these services should be a priority for the 

LEAs. Even if they do not publicize their location or the identity of their owners, there are software 

tools for the analysis of Internet domains that can be used to determine who are the likely owners 

or admi nistrators of the pages on which these platforms are hosted. If these VASPs are based on 

the dark web, it is possible to exploit, for the purpose of identifying the owners, the fact that their 

success is based on reputation, which means that there is an en ormous amount of potentially 

valuable information about them in specialized forums and pages. 

250. Notwithstanding the above, it should also be borne in mind that the standards established 

by the FATF on the subject do not require the exchange of VAs to be ch anneled through VASPs. 

“Peer -to -peer” transactions, without intermediaries, between holders of wallets that are not in 

custody are not covered by the AML/CFT regulations recommended by said organization. 

251. Several P2P platforms can be found on the Internet , such as LocalBitcoins, LocalCryptos, 

Local.Bitcoin.com, and Ccoins.io, among others, whose service is limited to connecting buyers and 

sellers with each other for the exchange of cryptocurrencies —either among themselves or with 

fiat currency —, without es tablishing payment mechanisms within the page or storing fiat money 

of its users. Some of these platforms only allow the exchange between VAs, but not their 

conversion to fiat money, such as Binance, Poloniex, Bittrex, Crypto Exchange, KuCoin, Changelly, 

ShapeShift, and PrimeXBT, among others. Some of these offer the possibility of carrying out 

CoinJoin or “Chain Hopping” maneuvers. 

252. Although the use of these sites could be used to carry out transactions with VAs while 

avoiding AML/CFT controls (where they have been implemented), their use has not yet become 

widespread. At present, VASPs continue to offer an easier and safer service to people wishing to 

trade cryptocurrencies, regardless of their origin (legal or illegal). The relative difficulty in carrying 

out P2P transactions functions, for the time being, as a limiting factor to their volume. However, 

if carrying out this type of operation without intermediaries were to become simpler and safer, 

this could lead to an increase in the number and value of tr ansactions not subject to AML/CFT 

controls and represent a vulnerability that must be addressed. 111 

253. Another point of exchange between VAs and fiat currency are the cryptocurrency kiosks 

or “ Bitcoin ATMs” that have begun to appear in cities in many parts of the world, including Latin       

> 110 Refer to: FANUSIE , Yaya J. / ROBINSON , Tom: “Bitcoin laundering: An analysis of illicit fl ows into digital currency services”, Elliptic

71 

America. In these ATMs, it is possible to exchange, buy or sell cryptocu rrencies (especially, but not 

exclusively, Bitcoins), although for a commission that is generally higher than in online exchange 

platforms. Although the companies operating these ATMs fall under the FATF definition of VASPs, 

the fact is that, even in count ries where their activity is regulated, most of these ATMs require 

only a limited amount of identifying information from their customers to carry out transactions, 

and in many cases the operators cannot guarantee that the documentation they receive is 

auth entic or that the user is not acting on behalf of a third party. 112 

254. Notwithstanding the above, the regular use of VA ATMs by persons under investigation 

may offer advantages for the investigation, since it constitutes a starting point for possible 

surveillance or follow -up tasks. In this regard, if it is known that t hese persons operate in certain 

places and use VA ATMs to carry out their illicit activity, it is possible to identify the ATMs located 

in the area through pages such as CoinATMradar 113 and establish surveillance points in order to 

determine the dates and t imes when they are used by the suspects. This can be used to request 

or obtain the information corresponding to the transactions carried out on that date and time 

(addresses used, type of VA involved, transaction amounts, etc.), or to track their subsequen t

movements in order to identify their potential partners or accomplices. 

C. Investigative techniques based on Blockchain analysis 

281. In addition to the information that can be obtained from VASPs, it is also possible to extract 

data of great relevance for asset investigations from the very structure underlying the operation 

of VAs. As explained above, the transactions of Bitcoin and most cryptocurrencies are based on 

the existence of a public registry —called Blockchain —in which they are confirmed and record ed 

(in chronological order) in order to guarantee the integrity of the system. 

282. The operation of the transfer and registration process is similar with respect to most known 

VAs, with the exception of some “private currencies.” Transactions are initiated w hen the seller 

transfers a certain amount of cryptocurrencies from his/her wallet to the buyer’s VA address, 

which represents the buyer’s wallet. When the transaction is validated by entering the seller’s 

private key, the network acknowledges the sending o f information and the network’s “miners” 

process the transaction and add the value of the transaction to the end of a computer data chain 

representing previous transactions. The “miners” then add a block containing the latest 

transactions transmitted to th e network following the last completed block, at a rate of 

approximately one block every ten minutes. 114 The resulting succession of blocks makes up the 

“blockchain.”

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets

72 

283. The Blockchain records all transactions carried out by the holder of a given VA 

wallet, in chronological order. For each transaction, the transaction ID (hash value), the 

date and time of the transaction, the source and destination address (there may be one or 

more source addresses and one or more destination addresses for each transaction), the 

amount transferred, the cost of the transaction (i.e., the commission charged by the miners 

who processed it) and the remaining balance (i.e., how many bitcoins are left for the sender 

and how many for the receiver at the end of the transaction) are re corded. 

284. The following image 115 illustrates how a transaction is reflected in the Bitcoin Blockchain. 

It shows the hash (the transaction ID), the date and time of the transaction, the sender’s address, 

the amount of bitcoins transferred, the receiver’s addr ess and the resulting balance. The “fee” 

section represents the commission assigned to the “miners” for processing the transaction, which, 

as can be seen, has not yet been confirmed. 

285. All this information is public, and can be consulted on many dif ferent websites, such as 

(with respect to Bitcoin)  https://explorer.bitcoin.com/btc . On the Blockchain it is also possible to 

consult the balance of each VA address, in which the complete history of transact ions, the total 

sent and received, and the resulting balance are recorded. 

286. From the data recorded in the Blockchain, investigative agencies can learn the complete 

transaction history of a given VA address, including the addresses of all the users with wh om it 

carried out transactions and the date, time, and exact amount transferred (which can be useful as 

a search criterion when analyzing many transactions simultaneously); as well as the complete chain 

of transactions made by each VA since its creation an d the IP addresses associated with each VA 

address (unless the user connects to the network through an anonymity tool such as a VPN or 

TOR system). The analysis of this dataset, and its cross -checking with information obtained from 

other sources (especiall y if carried out by means of “Big data” IT tools) can be crucial to detect 

criminal activity with VAs, identify its perpetrators and obtain incriminating evidence. 

287. For this reason, the analysis and tracing of transactions with VAs aimed at linking suspected 

persons with specific VA addresses or wallets should become a routine task in the framework of 

investigations on ML/TF schemes with VAs. 116 To this end, Blockchain analysis constitutes an

essential investigative tool, both to obtain evidence that serves to connect the persons under 

investigation with criminal activities or illicit proceeds, 117 and to seek the seizure and confiscation 

of such proceeds. A recent case illustrates the importance of this tool: 118 

288. The asset investigation is facilitated in cases where it is possible to trace the movements 

of VAs from and to a known VASP, especially if it is one that, because it is located in a jurisdiction 

where its operation is regulated, is subject to AML/CFT oblig ations. To this end, when —by any 

method —it is possible to identify the VA address(es) used by the person under investigation, the 

information recorded in the Blockchain can be used to determine whether he/she has operated 

with any VASP, and then require th ose responsible for the latter to provide the data associated 

with the address(es) obtained through CDD tasks. Another recent case illustrates the usefulness 

of this investigative strategy: 119

Case 3: Confiscation of Bitcoins stole n from Silk Road from Blockchain analysis: 

In November 2020, the U.S. government filed a motion to confiscate approximately 69,370 Bitcoins (BTC), Bitcoin 

Gold (BTG), Bitcoin SV (BSV) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) valued at USD 1 billion. 

These VAs had previously been seized as part of an investigation that traced the destination of bitcoins once 

belonging to the defunct Silk Road virtual marketplace that had been appropriated by an individual who managed to 

hack into the marketplace’s webs ite, obtain the passwords, and transfer the cryptocurrency to an account of his own 

whose address was 1HQ3Go3ggs8pFnXuHVHRytPCq5fGG8Hbh (hereinafter, 1HQ3). 

In 2020, with the assistance of a company specializing in Blockchain analysis, 54 transfers made i n early 2013 from 

Silk Road accounts to two Bitcoin addresses were detected: 1BADznNF3W1gi47R65MQs754KB7zTaGuYZ and 

1BBqjKsYuLEUE9Y5WzdbzCtYzCiQgHqtPN totaling 70,411.46 BTC (valued at approximately USD 354,000 at the 

time of transfer). The assets had been transferred in round amounts and in a short space of time. Thus, 10 of the 

transactions had taken place at 3:59, all for exactly 2,500 BTC, a pattern that is unusual for Bitcoin users. These 

transactions had not been recorded in the Silk Road database as withdrawals by sellers or employees, so it was 

inferred that they were assets stolen from the site. 

On April 9, 2013, from the two addresses that had received a total of 70,411.46 BTC, just over 69,471 BTC (valued 

at that time at USD 14 million) were tran sferred to the address 1HQ3. Then, on April 23, from the latter address 101 

BTC (approximately USD 23,000) were wired to BTC -e, an unregistered VA exchange platform. Between April 2015 

and November 2020, the remaining just over 69,370 BTC remained at 1HQ3. During that time frame, a portion of 

the VAs were converted to BCH, BTG, and BSV. An analysis of the Blockchains of each of the variants determined 

that the funds remained in 1HQ3. 

In November 2020, U.S. authorities identified the individual responsible for the theft of the Silk Road bitcoins, and 

he entered into an agreement whereby he consented to the seizure of the VAs by the U.S. government. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the

74 

289. The identification of the VA addresses of key players within the exchange networks of 

these assets is, therefore, a fundamental element for the “deanonymization” of specific users and 

the reconstruction of their contact networks. In view of this, it is im portant that the VA addresses 

of cryptocurrency exchange platforms, mixers, online gambling houses, illicit markets in the dark 

web, or of persons already identified as likely suspects of engaging in some illicit activity generating 

funds, or ML/TF, among others, that are identified in the course of investigations, are registered, 

ordered and cataloged to allow their subsequent use, both in the framework of the same 

investigation in which the identification was achieved and in other subsequent investigation s. LEAs 

should have as broad a base as possible of VA addresses with identified holders, as this facilitates 

the use of the Blockchain to allow the identification of other users who have contact with them. 120 

290. VA users involved in illicit activities can al so be identified through an analysis of the 

Blockchain focused on the patterns that emerge from their transaction history. This is so, since 

their activity generally differs from that of those engaged in licit activity. Thus, illegal users tend 

to carry ou t a greater number of transactions, but for smaller amounts. They are also more likely 

to carry out transactions with the same interlocutors. The reason for these differences in 

transactional behavior is that illicit users of VAs tend to use cryptocurrenci es (almost) exclusively 

to facilitate the trafficking of illegal goods and services (or to recycle funds originating from such 

trafficking or from other crimes), while for licit users VAs are generally treated as an investment. 

Consequently, illicit users tend to hold on to VAs for less time, which is consistent with the 

intention of preventing their seizure by the authorities. 121        

> 120 Refer to: FATF: “Guidance on financial investigations involving virtual assets,” June 2019, p. 52 § 180.

> cryptocurrencies? ” The Review of Financial Studie s, Vol. 32, No. 5, 2019, pp. 1798/1853.

Case 4: Welcome to video. Tracking of Bitcoin transaction s to identify customers of a page dedicated 

to the exchange of child sexual exploitation images: 

A joint operation between authorities in South Korea, the U.S. and eleven other countries led to the 

identification and arrest of 337 users of the “Welcome to video” (WTV) site, which operated on the Dark 

Web and was dedicated to the exchange of child sexual exploitation images. 

After identifying and arresting the site’s administrator in South Korea in early 2018, investigators sent 

small amounts of bitcoins to the Bitcoin wallets that the site assigned to users. From there, VA 

movements from each of those wallets were tracked through Blockchain analysis, which allowed them 

to be connected to the addresses of US -based VA exchange platforms (subject to AML/CFT obl igations). 

With the data provided by those responsible for such platforms in compliance with court orders, it was 

possible to identify and arrest the users who had resorted to those services for the exchange of VAs 

linked to WTV’s operations. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets

75 

291. Similarly, a VA user is more likely to be involved in illicit activities if he/she uses “mixers” 

in his/her transactions or car ries out the type of operations (such as CoinJoin or “chain hopping”) 

aimed at preventing the reconstruction of the transfer chain. On a more general level, the web of 

transactions between illicit users tends to be considerably denser than those among lici t users, 

with the different actors much more closely connected to each other through cross -transactions. 

This is consistent with the tendency of such users to use VAs primarily for trafficking in illicit goods 

and services and other criminal activities. 

292. Based on this, within the framework of Blockchain analysis, different methods coexist to 

seek the deanonymization of VA users, always based on the data known and the exploitation of 

the inherent characteristics of the cryptocurrency ecosystem that facilita te the identification of 

those who operate in that area. These include: 

• The tracking of transactions originating from the “hot wallets” (online) of the main illicit 

markets of the Dark Web, collecting the addresses of all customers and mining the resulti ng 

information. 

• The segmentation (“Clustering”) of users based on the differences —already outlined —

between those who usually operate with funds of illicit origin and those who resort to VAs 

for licit purposes. 

• Exploring the topology of the VA network to id entify “communities” of users based on the 

transactions among them. 

• The use of information contained in forums and other areas of the dark web on users of 

VAs involved in illegal operations, including addresses of VAs, pseudonyms or nicknames, 

references to their activity that may provide clues as to their location, etc. 

293. The use of Blockchain analysis (or “Chain analysis”) as an investigative technique requires 

the use of the appropriate technological tools, in addition to the necessary technical knowledg e to 

use them. In terms of tools, at the primary level, a Blockchain explorer is used, which is a network 

application that operates as a sort of search engine in the VA ecosystem, making it possible to find 

addresses, transactions, and other data linked to them. Open -source versions of these applications 

are available for free download on the Internet. 122 

294. There are also more sophisticated computer resources, specifically designed for the needs 

of investigative agencies, in the hands of private companies s pecialized in Blockchain analysis such 

as Chainalysis, Elliptic, Ciphertrace, or Blockchain Intelligence Group, among others. The methods 

used by these companies allow mapping transactions made with bitcoins with up to 90%   

> 122 Refer to: FATF: “Guidance on financial investigations involving virtual assets,” June 2019, p. 25 § 77. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the

76 

effectiveness; 123 and tools have b een developed for the analysis of the main Altcoins, such as 

Litecoin and Ethereum, which have similar characteristics to Bitcoin. 124 Moreover, the 

technological capabilities in the hands of these private companies may prove to be the only way 

to trace the destination of cryptocurrencies in cases of “chainhopping.” 

295. Although the use of Blockchain analysis techniques may seem to be a resource outside the 

scope of traditional investigative agencies, it constitutes a key element of any investigation linked 

to VAs. 125 For this purpose, if it is decided not to develop the necessary technological tools 

internally, public -private cooperation with companies specialized in Chain analysis (which, 

moreover, have extensive databases of VA addresses with already deanonymized ho lders) can be 

a good alternative, also recommended by agencies such as CARIN. 

296. In the latter case, it is necessary that the LEAs or units of the Public Prosecutor’s Office 

involved have agents or officials prepared to explain the findings of these compani es in the 

framework of the judicial proceedings that take place in connection with the criminal behavior 

with VAs under investigation. In this regard, it is recommended that a good working relationship 

be maintained with the personnel of the companies prov iding the service, especially if they may 

be called upon to testify on how the findings presented were arrived at. 126 

D. Open -source intelligence and electronic surveillance techniques 

297. The information that emerges from Blockchain analysis can be complemen ted with data or 

evidence from other sources, or obtained through the use of traditional investigative techniques, 

such as surveillance, monitoring, or the interrogation of witnesses or persons of interest. An 

effective way to exploit the profusion of digi tal data that characterizes modern societies is to 

resort to “ open -source intelligence” (OSINT) techniques, a term that refers to the systematic 

collection, processing, and analysis of open access information. That is, information available to 

the general public without restrictions. 127 

298. With regard to asset investigations into illicit VA activities, OSINT can be used, for example, 

to obtain data on the holders of Bitcoin addresses or other Altcoins already known to the 

investigators. To this end, attempts can be made to place the VA address in Internet search 

engines, as it is quite common for individuals engaged in illicit online trading (or terrorist 

organizations seeking to raise funds through VAs) to post their address (associating it with their 

online profile and pseudonym) in forums (such as Reddit, 4Chan, 8Chan) or in the comments

sections of specialized cryptocurrency or IT websites. In addition, websites specifically dedicated 

to the identification of Bitcoin users and the addresses associated with them, such as 

walletexplorer.com, can be consulted. 

299. The same technique can be used to obtain information on the Dark Web, where there are 

multiple forums (Dread, Darknet Avengers, The Hub, Exploit.in) in which, taking advantage of the 

anonymity conferred by TOR login, people freely share information on hidden services, including 

their addresses, the products and services they offer, comments on the quality of the service, 

nicknames of the most (or least) successful traders, etc. 

300. In this regard, it is im portant to bear in mind two issues. Firstly, the pseudonyms or names 

used online by persons who carry out their illicit activity in this area are rarely modified. This is 

because, on the one hand, the success of their commercial activity on the Internet is generally 

closely linked to their online reputation (i.e., to the comments made about them in virtual bazaars 

or forums). On the other hand, people who spend a large part of their lives on the Internet tend to 

develop a strong attachment to the pseudonyms that identify them on the Net, and are reluctant 

to stop using them, even when this would be advisable for reasons of operational security, as 

reflected in the following case: 128 

301. Secondly, it should be borne in mind that online pseudonyms often have a correlate either 

on the surface web (when the individual acts mostly on the dark web) or even in real life, which —

if discovered —may allow linking the illicit activity to his or her real identity. In such a context, LEAs 

can take advantage of mistakes that people often make when splitting their online identity from

Case 5: Albert González. Online identity maintenance as a key element in linking an individual to illicit 

activity: 

After being arrested in the framework of an investigation into the use of cloned debit cards, the American 

hacker Albert González began to work together with the US Secret Service, advising and training its agents 

on computer -related issues. 

However, at the same time and unbeknown to the authorities, González organized a new group of hackers 

with which he carried out a series of major computer attacks on the systems of several U.S. companies, 

obtaining the private data of millions of credit card users, which he sold to buyers in Russia to be used in 

the development of twin cards. 

González’s involvement in the aforementioned illicit activity was discovered when his Russian buyer was 

arrested while trying to enter t he U.S., when the analysis of his personal computer revealed that his 

accomplice’s pseudonym was “Soup Nazi,” precisely the same one that González had been using since 

before being apprehended for the first time, and which he maintained even in his interac tions with Secret 

Service agents. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the

their real -life (secret) identity, such as not rememberin g to use anonymous surfing tools at some 

point, using the same VA address for illicit and licit activities, or using an e -mail address associated 

with their real name in connection with their online identity. This is illustrated in the case below: 129 

302. For the same reasons, OSINT techniques can also be effective in obtaining information on 

unregistered VASPs providing services to persons engaged in illicit conduct with VAs, including 

mixers or P2P cryptocurrency exchange platforms, whether on the s urface web or on the dark 

web. This is so, since these are run on the same reputation -based system as illegal online 

marketplaces, dependent on feedback from market participants in the feedback window or on 

specialized forums, where other users are alerted about the quality of the service, whether it is 

still online or down, whether it is fraudulent, etc. In such a context, investigators can anonymously 

access these forums or pages (just like any other Net user) and obtain useful data on illegal or 

unregist ered VASPs operating in a given country (or providing services to persons from that 

country) and, on that basis, try to identify those who may be operating with the person(s) under 

investigation. 

303. In addition, OSINT techniques can be applied to link person s suspected of being involved 

in illicit conduct generating funds with the suspected launderers of such funds. Indeed, even if 

communications between the two parties are carried out exclusively in cyberspace and through 

anonymity tools, it is likely that t here is data that can be used as evidence of the existence of a 

relationship between them. This, since it is improbable that a person engaged in a criminal activity 

would entrust the control of his/her earnings to a launderer, in the absence of a prior bon d of trust 

or any circumstance that would justify the delivery of the funds to a third party. 

304. Finally, open -source information may be useful to better understand the lifestyle, the 

assets of the suspect, or the places where he/she resides or carries out h is/her commercial or 

social activity. This, bearing in mind that sometimes even the most capable criminals (or their family 

or friends) can reveal compromising information through posts on social media such as Facebook, 

Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, etc.

79 

305. Also, with respect to this information, it is important to keep in mind that in every 

application there are at least two layers of data that can be exploited for an investigation. First, 

the content layer, which includes the information “published” by the u ser (messages, photos, 

videos, etc.). In this regard, the images posted can provide a lot of data about a person, not only 

about their physical appearance, but also about their environment, location, status, ideology, etc. 

Especially when images are “tagge d,” associating them to profiles of users of the social media 

network or even to people who have not logged in to the service). 

306. Below the first layer, there is a second layer made up of metadata, which can provide 

information about the computer through w hich the content was published, the users themselves, 

or a description of the files. A typical example of this last type of metadata is given by the EXIF 

data (“Exchangeable image file format”) contained in the videos or images, which describe the 

equipmen t and settings with which the video or image was obtained. Depending on the equipment 

used, the image or video metadata may also include information about the date, time and location 

in which it was created. This data can create opportunities to obtain clu es or draw conclusions 

about individuals or organizations associated with those files or the social media accounts on 

which they were posted. Even seemingly innocuous aspects such as SSL (“Secure Sockets Layer”) 

certificates on web pages can provide inform ation about the site owner. 

307. The advantage of using OSINT as an investigative tool is that —especially compared to 

Blockchain analysis —it does not require advanced technical knowledge, which means that the use 

of this resource is not limited to cybercrime s pecialists. On the contrary, all investigators should 

be able to search open sources and collect publicly available information. 130 

308. In addition, a variety of technological tools have been developed in order to make the 

search process easier and automatic, such as Maltego or Spokeo, among others. There are also a 

number of purpose -specific search engines on the Web, such as Shodan, which helps locate 

various technologies including webcams, printers, VoIP devices, and routers, among others; 

NameCHK, which is a tool for checking whether a user name is available on a variety of online 

services; Tineye, a reverse image search service (an image is added and it shows whether the image 

is found somewhere on the Internet); and Pipl, which searches for matches on the Internet based 

on different criteria such as names, email addresses or telephone numbers. There are also pages 

on the surface web that provide information about the nature and status (online or offline) of 

hidden services or pages on the Darknet and its m irrors, such as Dark.fail or the TNO Dark Web 

Monitor. Other tools, such as GitHub, can be used to perform OSINT tasks on the Darknet. 

309. In addition, the Basel Institute has developed a proprietary tool to streamline the search 

process called “Basel Open Intelligence,” which performs automated searches of a person’s or  

> 130 Refer to: Police Executiv e Research Forum (PERF): “The changing nature of crime and criminal investigations,” 2018, p. 51. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the

80 

organization’s name, combined with more than 200 keywords on financial c rimes, prosecutions, 

other crimes, and customized keyword lists. It also searches the Dark Web, selecting any 

references on sanctions lists and politically exposed persons. The tool can conduct searches in 

multiple languages and offers its users the option to automatically translate articles into their 

language to facilitate analysis. Documents found in the search are listed along with the main text 

extracted from the website, excluding irrelevant content (such as advertising, menus, or cookie 

notices) and highlighting keywords for easier reading. 131 

310. In addition to the data collected by the investigative agencies themselves using OSINT 

techniques, already processed information on persons of interest can be obtained by using the 

services of so -called “data b rokers.” These companies are engaged in the collection and processing 

of information from multiple sources and the elaboration of detailed personal profiles, 132 which 

include data such as age, gender, education, employment, and residential history, relation ships, 

number of children, purchases, activities, use of social media, political opinions, race and religion, 

income, vehicle and property ownership, details of banking and insurance products purchased, 

credit card purchases in the last 24 months, socioeco nomic status, economic stability, etc. 

311. OSINT techniques are most effective when combined with the use of traditional 

investigative measures such as physical surveillance or monitoring, inspection of waste discarded 

by the persons of interest, requests fo r reports, production orders and/or personal or house 

searches, obtaining witness statements, etc. Many successful asset investigations are based on the 

effective combination of these traditional practices with more sophisticated techniques, typical of 

an investigation that is totally or partially linked to activities developed in the online environment. 

The following cases exemplify the usefulness of adopting this strategy: 133

Case 7: Investigation with combined techniques: 

In 2017, following the ar rest of a drug trafficker operating on the Darknet, an investigation involving the cyber customs 

unit of the French police was launched following the discovery of a user profile and VA address on an online forum of that 

network. Various methodologies were used, including the action of undercover online agents; the tracing of transactions 

on the Blockchain in order to reconstruct the network of contacts between cryptocurrency exchange platforms, online 

marketplaces and mixers, and list the transactions made between these; production orders were issued to obtain and 

analyze data; requests for information were issued to VA exchange platforms and wallet service providers about online 

pseudonyms and transactions associated with them; and test purchases were made. Although the investigation was mostly 

focused on bitcoins, the target also conducted transactions with Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Monero, Ripple, Litecoin, and 

Zcash. The funds involved were estimated at approximately EUR 700,000 over a period of 9 months. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the

81 

312. In turn, technological advances in recent years have led to traditional measures such as 

surveillance or tracking with electronic devices that increase their effectiveness, lower their costs, 

and considerably broaden their scope. In addition to providing u seful information or evidence for 

any investigation into organized crime —such as the identification of other individuals associated 

with suspects, the reconstruction of links and activities, the discovery of the possible location of 

assets or property info rmation of interest, etc. —the use of electronic means of surveillance can 

also serve to ascertain relevant data for investigations into illicit conduct involving VAs, such as 

connections with cryptocurrency exchange platforms, mixers, online gambling sites , P2P networks 

dedicated to the transfer of VAs, or cloud storage services. Likewise, the type of computing 

devices used by the persons under investigation, whether they have one or more online wallets, 

the preferred methods of communication or whether the y use public Wi -Fi connections or other 

electronic means that can be accessed by the authorities can also be ascertained in this way. 134 

313. To this end, an effective method is the monitoring of the Internet traffic of the persons 

under investigation. 135 In th is regard, it should be noted that this monitoring includes much more 

than the capture of e -mail exchanges. This is because, in fact, only a small part of Internet traffic 

comprises “human -to -human” communications such as e -mails. Most Internet communicati ons are

Case 8. “Pedro el grande.” Combination of traditional and online techniques. 

In February 2017, 18 -year -old Aisha Zughbieh -Collins was found lifeless in her apartment from an overdose of the synthetic 

opioid U -47700 (U4). The victim’s mother, suspecting that she had purchased the drug on the Internet, provided detectives 

with her em ail address. In addition, evidence was found at the crime scene indicating that the drug had been sent through 

the mail, concealed in a specific variant of a pregnancy test sold at the Dollar Tree Store pharmacy chain. Although the 

return address was deter mined to be false, it was possible to establish from which post office the packaging had been 

purchased. 

The most relevant finding, however, was a notebook in which an alphanumeric code had been written down, which turned 

out to be the victim’s private cr yptographic key for Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) communications encryption software. By 

accessing the victim’s email with the code, investigators were able to discover that he had purchased the drugs on a virtual 

marketplace on the Dark Web from a seller nick named “Pedro el grande,” who, as indicated on the page itself, had made 

more than 10,000 transactions. 

Investigators made a controlled purchase of U4 from “Pedro el grande,” which they received concealed in the same type of 

pregnancy test found in the vic tim’s apartment. It was determined that these tests had been purchased through an online 

sales company that only accepted Bitcoin payments, and was linked to two email addresses, the holder of which was 

identified as Theodore Khleborod, domiciled in Greenv ille. Investigators were able to determine that Khleborod had 

received numerous international shipments from China (one of the countries where the drug U4 is manufactured). Also, 

through analysis of the named individual’s social media posts, it was establi shed that he was in a relationship with a woman 

named Ana Barrero. 

Inquiries in the town of Greenville revealed an increase in sales of pregnancy tests at a specific Dollar Tree Store chain 

store. Footage from the store’s video cameras showed that Ana Bar rero had made multiple purchases of pregnancy tests 

at that store. While surveilling the homes of Khleborod and Barrero, investigators witnessed Barrero send numerous 

packages similar to the one found in the victim’s apartment. They were both arrested. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the

between humans and computers, such as World Wide Web (WWW) pages in transit, commands 

sent to remote servers, and file transfers. Many others involve communications between 

computers, such as the administrative network traffic that keeps the Intern et running. These 

communications can also provide relevant information, which can be captured in many different 

formats: large digital documents, images, audio files, videos, and even telephone communications 

over the Web. 

314. It is also important to bear i n mind that Internet monitoring, by its very nature, always 

involves the analysis of all the data traffic flowing through the specific point of the network where 

the interception takes place, in order to identify, among all of them, those that are of inter est to 

the investigation (just like a policeman who wants to find a suspicious individual in a crowd and 

must observe, in order to identify him/her, all the people who are there). In this context, this 

measure requires computer tools specially designed to filter the data, so as to capture only those 

whose collection is covered by the corresponding judicial authorization. 

315. In many cases, the monitoring of network traffic will not allow access to the content of 

Internet communications, since it is increasingl y common for these to be encrypted. In general, 

however, it will be possible to capture the so -called “wrapper data,” i.e. all those that do not form 

part of the content of the communication, but refer to the mechanisms for its execution (source 

and destin ation IP addresses, data volume, Internet nodes involved in the exchange of data 

packets, etc.). 136 This is unless one of the parties to the communication has resorted to an 

anonymity tool (such as the TOR system or a VPN) to mask its real IP address. 

316. Mor eover, modern technologies also facilitate the tracking of individuals, since it is no 

longer necessary to involve multiple agents and vehicles to physically follow the persons under 

investigation, but the measure can be carried out by means of GPS devices that allow the 

simultaneous tracking of several persons, for many days and at a considerably lower cost. In turn, 

the proliferation of the use of mobile applications on “smart phones” (for navigation, social media, 

online shopping or banking, etc.), in ma ny cases associated with GPS embedded in the cell phones 

themselves, offers another means for prospective —or even retrospective — tracking of persons 

under investigation. 137 

317. Indeed, the very design of cell phone communication networks (3G or 4G) implies co nstant 

contact between the devices and the cell phone towers to allow the background operation of 

network applications, regardless of whether or not the user is using the cell phone to communicate. 

Each of these contacts between the cell phone and the towe rs generates a record that is stored 

by the telephone company, which includes the date and time and the specific cell with which the

83 

connection was established. These snippets of information, called “Cell site location information” 

(CSLI), are extremely us eful, as they not only allow us to locate the person at a specific place at a 

specific time, but also to reconstruct the history of their movements over days or even months. 

E. Relevant evidence or clues in the computer systems of persons of interest 

318. When —as is the case with the conducts referred to in this guide —the object of an 

investigation refers to illicit activities carried out in cyberspace or by means of computer 

equipment (including modern smartphones, which are, in essence, portable computers), t he 

devices that store digital information become a fundamental reservoir, either of evidence or of 

data relevant to the progress of the investigation. Among the elements that can be obtained there 

are the following: 

• Evidence or indications of VAs use. 

• Evidence or indications of contacts with cryptocurrency exchange platforms (either VASP 

or P2P platforms), mixers, online gambling sites, etc. 

• Evidence or indications of use of cloud storage services. 

• Evidence or indications of the use of anonymity tools ( TOR, I2P, VPNs). 

• Evidence or indications of the use of encryption tools. 

• Keys or passwords to access information stored in the cloud or to disable encryption. 

• Evidence or indications of communications with other suspicious persons (holders of funds 

of illi cit origin, terrorist organizations, money launderers, etc.). 

• Property documentation or other relevant evidence in digital format (company 

incorporation documents, accounting records, images or data on assets, agendas, etc.). 

319. This digital information or e vidence can be found on an increasingly wide range of 

technological devices, including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, smartphones, smart readers 

(such as Kindle), portable GPS equipment, digital cameras, flash drives, SD cards, pen drives, 

removable hard disks, external “cloud” servers (such as Dropbox, Google Drive, Box. Net, Amazon 

Cloud Drive) and compact discs (CDs, DVDs, Blurays); as well as smart devices within the so -called 

“Internet of Things” (IoT). 138 Therefore, as far as possible, a thorough forensic analysis of all 

electronic devices confiscated from the persons under investigation should be carried out. 139

84 

320. There are several elements that, if found on computer equipment, would indicate that its 

owner uses or has used VAs. Firstly, the exist ence of a cryptocurrency wallet. For the main 

cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, the original wallet is Bitcoin Core, which groups together the vast majority 

of Bitcoin nodes. One of the main differences between this application and other similar ones is 

that Bitcoi n Core downloads the complete Blockchain to the user’s computer, which takes up quite 

a lot of space (more than 300 GB). 140 Other VAs wallets commonly used on desktop computers 

include Exodus, mSIGNA, Electrum, Mycelium, Bitcoin Core, Green Address, MultiBi t HD, Armory, 

Copay, and Jaxx. Currently, most wallets are so -called “HD wallets” (“ Hierarchical deterministic 

wallets”), in which all keys are derived from a single master key, known as the “seed.” 

321. The files containing the wallets are usually identified as wallet.dat. They are in turn 

represented by identifying icons, as illustrated in the following image, which reproduces those of 

some of the most popular virtual wallets: 

322. VA addresses eventually discovered in the wallets in control of sus picious persons may be 

subject to Blockchain analysis in order to reconstruct their transfer history, and the addresses of 

other users with whom they have been linked. 

323. The existence of software corresponding to Massively Multiplayer Online Role -Playing 

Video Games (MMORPGs) may also indicate the use of VAs, since these programs offer virtual 

assets that can be acquired to interact within the game, such as Second Life Linden Dollars, Project 

Entropia Dollars, or World -of -Warcraft Gold. 141

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets

85 

324. Another source of potentially valuable information is found in the browsing history of 

computers or smartphones, which may reveal contacts with VASPs, or cryptocurrency P2P 

exchange platforms. The presence of applications such as “Portfolio trackers” (which offer updated 

information on the price of different cryptocurrencies) also indicate the use of VAs, as well as the 

record of visits to discussion forums or pages with information on cryptocurrencies. 142 

325. In the case of cell phones, it can be verified whether they contain applications for two -

factor authentication linked to online wallets, whether in custody or not. Similarly, the possible use 

of cloud storage services should also be verified. In this regard, it is worth bearing in mind that VAs 

do not necessarily have to be on the personal computer or cell phone of the person under 

investigation, since the wallets —except for the aforementioned Bitcoin Core —generally take up 

little space (less than 100 bytes) and can be stored on any device, as well as on external s ervers. 

Web -based email services can also be used, some of which offer privacy features as an additional 

service. 143 Cloud storage can be inferred both from the presence of software associated with such 

services and from records in the browsing history refl ecting the use of such services. 

326. In addition, the devices of the persons under investigation may contain keys or passwords 

that allow access to password -protected desktop or mobile VA wallets; to “custodial” online 

wallets hosted on pages that offer this service; to external servers of cloud data storage 

companies; or to encrypted documents found in the computer equipment of such persons or in 

any data storage device that supports the use of such tools. Passwords can be found in: 

• Text files such as Word or Notepad, spreadsheets such as Excel or even as images. 

• Applications for computers or smartphones that manage user passwords, which are usually 

also accessed through a password, which can be biometric (fingerprint or facial 

recognition). 

• In some browsers , which also offer the possibility of storing passwords associated with 

access to web pages (such as those that host “custodial” wallets or provide cloud computing 

services). 144 

327. Finally, the finding of elements that indicate the use of anonymity tools, alt hough it does 

not constitute, by itself, evidence of criminal activity, may be relevant if it is suspected that the 

person under investigation uses such tools to carry out money laundering activities involving VAs.

86 

In this regard, it is necessary to pay at tention to the possible discovery of different programs, 145 

namely: 

• Browsers for the dark web, such as the TOR system, which are used to access hidden 

services on the dark web such as illicit online marketplaces, where VAs are the only 

accepted payment cu rrency. These programs can be found not only in desktop (for 

computers) or mobile (for smartphones) versions, but also in devices —such as Tails —where 

the browser is hosted on a USB that is connected to the computer when you want to 

browse anonymously and i s removed at the end of the session, leaving no trace of its use 

on the computer. Below are the browser icons of the TOR and I2P systems: 

• Presence or use of programs for browsing through virtual private networks (VPNs). 

• Presence or use of “virtual machine” programs such as VMware Workstation, OrAOPe VM 

VirtualBox, QEMU, Parallels Desktop, VMware Fusion, or Microsoft Virtual PC, which 

allow the user to host a second operating system (called “guest”) within his/her main 

ope rating system (“host”). Many of these “virtual machines” allow the entire content to be 

encrypted, so that it cannot be executed without entering the password. Thus, illicit activity 

with VAs can be carried out entirely through this “virtual machine,” with out any evidence 

of it on the “host” operating system, and keeping the evidence encrypted on the parallel 

operating system (“guest”). 

• Presence or use of encryption technology such as Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) or other 

similar programs (such as EFS, FileVau lt, Utimaco, GnuPG, and TrueCrypt, whose icons are 

reproduced below), which is often used by those who carry out illicit conducts on the dark 

web to communicate with each other or to safeguard potentially incriminating information.

87 

• Presence of applications to erase file metadata. 

• Browsing history including searches for information related to browsing the dark web, or 

tutorials for the use of some of the programs mentioned above. 

F. Special investigative techniques 

328. Notwithstandi ng the above, in cases where crypto -laundering schemes using VAs are 

particularly sophisticated, a possible alternative for obtaining information or evidence that would 

not otherwise be available is to resort to special investigative techniques such as und ercover 

actions, always within the framework of what is permitted by the procedural legislation in force in 

each country. 

329. In this regard, the FATF 146 emphasizes that the same programs and evasive techniques 

used by criminals to anonymously carry out their criminal activities in cyberspace can be used by 

the LEAs to infiltrate criminal organizations on the Internet and promote greater effectiveness in 

the development of asset investigations on ML/TF schemes with VAs. Indeed, the possibility of 

surfing anony mously on the Internet through tools such as TOR or VPNs, as well as the common 

use of “alternative identities” in cyberspace, facilitates the use of “digital undercover agents” to 

interact on the Internet with persons under investigation and/or potential criminals, infiltrate 

organizations, and gather evidence that can be used to obtain a conviction. 

330. The advantage of undercover operations in cyberspace, compared to those traditionally 

conducted in the physical world, is that they require far less plannin g, development, and 

coordination efforts, while significantly reducing the risks to undercover agents. However, it is 

important to bear in mind that Blockchain analysis tools can also be used by criminals, which is 

why if an agent is going to act undercove r on the Internet carrying out transactions with VAs, it is 

important that a transaction history be generated beforehand that is related to the “profile” that 

he/she will represent on the Net. 

331. Anonymity tools are not the only programs commonly used by cri minals that can also be 

of use to investigative agencies. In recent years, the use of spyware or Trojans for investigative

purposes has become more widespread. These can be used to realize various measures useful for 

investigations. Namely: 

• To remotely access information or digital evidence whose physical location is unknown or 

impossible to access effectively ( e.g., because access could not be achieved before the data 

is destroyed or altered by the persons under investigation). For this purpose , the spyware 

is introduced into the suspect’s system and programmed to select the relevant data and 

send it to a computer controlled by the intervening authority. 

• To obtain the passwords needed to access the contents of encrypted documents or 

information stored on external servers. For this purpose, a “keylogger” program is used, 

which records everything typed by the device user in which the spyware is introduced 

(including the passwords to be obtained), as occurred in the following case: 147 

• To monitor communications made over the Internet, using communication technologies 

that make interception by traditional means (VoIP or encrypted messaging systems) 

impossible. In these cases, the spyware captures the data packets in which the content of 

the communication is transmitted (in text, audio or video format) not when they are “in 

transit” on the Internet (since they will usually be encrypted), but just before the 

information goes out, or just after it enters the device in which the spyware was 

intro duced. This is illustrated in the case below: 148

Case 9: Nicodemo Scarfo. Use of spyware to obtain the password to an encrypted file: 

As part of the ongoing U.S. investigation into two alleged New Jersey mob bosses, Frank Paolercio and 

Nicodemo Scarfo Jr, the FBI searched the latter’s office. Upon searching his computer, they discovered a 

file protected with Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) encryption software, the contents of which they were 

unable to access. 

Suspecting that the file might contain relevant evidence, the agency obtained a new court order 

authorizing it to physically install a keylogger on Scarfo’s computer for one month. 

At the end of that period, the FBI searched the office again and seized the computer. From the analysis 

of the information collected by the keylogger program, which had recorded everyt hing typed by the 

computer’s users, the agency was able to obtain the password to access the contents of the encrypted 

file, which included evidence of the illegal activity of Scarfo and his partner and led to their conviction. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the

• To conduct acoustic or audiovisual surveillance, using the spyware to remotely enable the 

microphones or cameras of devices held by (or in the vicinity of) the persons under 

investigation. 

• To locate or track in real time the persons under investigation, e ither by programming the 

spyware to remotely turn on the GPS embedded in the devices (e.g. cell phones) carried by 

the persons under investigation; or, by hacking into the computer of the person under 

investigation, to detect and transmit to the investigat ors the real IP address assigned to the 

equipment he/she uses to surf the Internet. An example of the latter is illustrated in the 

following case: 149 

332. Although in the cases described above, the use of spyware by law enforcement agencies 

occurred in cases involving traditional cybercrimes such as the distribution of images of child

Case 11: Playpen. Use of “watering hole attack” for infiltration of multiple suspicious persons: 

In 201 4, the FBI located in the state of Florida the servers of the “Playpen” page, located on the Dark 

Web, dedicated to the distribution of child sexual exploitation images. 

In order to identify the users who downloaded or uploaded illicit images (whose IP ad dresses could not be 

known due to the use of the TOR system to connect to the page), the referred agency obtained judicial 

authorization to take control and operate Playpen for a month, as well as to introduce in it a spyware 

program designed to enter the users’ computer every time one of them uploaded or downloaded files 

containing images of child sexual exploitation, and send from there information including the real IP 

address, the characteristics of the equipment in which it had been introduced, and its geographic location. 

Based on this information, the FBI obtained search warrants in more than 40 districts in that country, 

where they seized the computers of Playpen users, which stored files containing evidence of possession 

and distribution of child s exual exploitation images. 

Case 10: Encrochat. Use of “supply chain attack” for mass infiltration of encrypted cell phone users: 

In the context of a three -year operation by French and Dutch authorities regarding the Encrochat 

netwo rk, used by major criminal organizations in Europe to communicate via fully encrypted modified 

cell phones, the French justice system authorized the implantation of a computer virus on the company’s 

servers, located in the city of Lille, which was then dow nloaded on all the devices in the hands of users 

(more than 60,000) by instrumentalizing updates sent by the company itself (hence the name “supply 

chain attack”). 

Once installed on the devices, the spyware sent to the investigation agency’s headquarters a ll the 

information stored on the cell phones (corresponding to the previous two weeks), as well as the 

messages exchanged thereafter. Investigators were thus able to analyze more than one million 

messages, which in turn led —in the Netherlands alone —to the arrest of more than 100 people, the 

seizure of 8 tons of cocaine, 1,200 kilograms of methamphetamine, and almost EUR 20 million in cash 

and the dismantling of more than 19 synthetic drug laboratories, as well as preventing the commission 

of homicides and o ther serious crimes. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the

sexual exploitation or cases related to organized crime, there are also examples of the use of this 

tool —combined with other measures —in the framework of investigations related to ML schemes 

involving VAs: 150 

333. It is likely that state use of spyware is considered as a resource outside the activity of 

traditional investigative agencies, reserved only to specialized units/in cybersecurity issues; or too 

controversial to be accepted by the courts. The truth is, however, that in view of the availability 

of advanced technological tools to act anonymously on the Internet and/or anti -forensic 

techniques to prevent the collection of digital evidence, it is imperative that the LEAs adapt their 

strategies and methods to sustain the effectiveness of asset investigations. 151 Such was the 

recommendation of the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) 152 in the framework of 

the s ummit held in 2015 on the influence of new technologies in criminal investigation. 153 

334. The concrete implementation of the state use of programs requires three stages: first, 

analyzing the use that the person under investigation makes of the networks, to det ermine which 

platforms or applications he/she uses (and the possible vulnerabilities of such platforms or 

applications, which can be exploited to enter the system); second, compromising the platform to 

introduce the most appropriate “exploit;” and third, m onitoring the information captured from the 

target. 

335. The initial recognition stage is essential, since computer intrusion tools are designed to 

work with respect to specific versions of a given application or operating system. This is done by 

means of a va riant of OSINT techniques (known as “OS fingerprinting”) aimed at collecting and 

analyzing the public information exposed by the systems when connecting to a controlled server 

(operating system, version, browser, installed plugins, installed fonts, screen resolution, among

Case 12: Mixer Case (Netherlands) Spyware VA investigation? 

The case focused on the activity of a person acting as a facilitator for criminals in VA markets, advertising 

services consisting of providing assistance in circumventing know -your -customer poli cies through the use 

of mixers (in particular Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin). The target claimed to operate from Curacao, 

with an approximate turnover of USD 200 million (approximately 25,000 bitcoins). However, his 

operational infrastructure was loc ated in Europe. 

During the course of the investigation, standard methods (such as the requesting of asset information or 

conducting interviews, interception of communications, and the seizure of hardware and other IT 

infrastructure) were combined with mor e advanced methods, such as the use of “digital intrusion” 

techniques. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets

91 

others). The technique consists of grouping this set of data, generating a “fingerprint” of the user, 

which can be useful for identification purposes. The last phase of this recognition stage consists 

of analyzing the target’s system to d iscover vulnerabilities and establish what defensive means it 

has (firewall, antivirus), in order to choose the most suitable means to enter the device in question. 

336. The next step is crucial, as it consists of introducing the spyware into the system or 

equ ipment of the person under investigation, which nowadays (unlike the “Scarfo” case, described 

above), is generally done remotely ( i.e., without physical access to the intruded system/device). 

For this purpose, different methods have been developed to send the spyware and compromise 

the computer system or device of the person under investigation, the choice of which depends on 

different factors (the purpose for which the spyware is used, the characteristics of the applications 

or systems to be intruded, the purpose and nature of the investigation, among others). Thus, for 

example, if spyware is intended to be used to install a “keylogger,” or to carry out acoustic or 

audiovisual surveillance of a particular person, an input vector can be chosen consisting of a text 

message or email specially designed to pretend to come from a known source, so as to trick the 

recipients into opening an attachment or clicking on a link that will allow the spyware to enter the 

system (a method known as “Spear Phishing”). This is illustrated in the case below: 154 

337. More recently, some companies specialized in the development of spyware for 

government use have begun to offer more advanced tools, with the so -called “zero -click” system, 

which consists of sending an SMS that introduces the spyware upon receipt, which doe s not 

require the targeted individual to perform any action to that effect and does not even appear on 

the screen, which considerably reduces the risk of detection. 

338. However, if the objective of the investigation is to identify the users or customers of a 

clandestine mixer on the dark web, the spyware can be surreptitiously installed on the site itself, 

programming it so that it is automatically introduced into the computers of any user who performs

Case 13: “Spear phishing.” Sending a link containing spyware to a specific suspicious person: 

As part of an investigation into bomb threats to a Washington state school in the U.S., identification of 

the person responsi ble was impeded by the instrumentality of computers “infected” by a computer virus 

for sending the threats. 

To circumvent this obstacle, the agency in charge of the investigation requested judicial authorization to 

insert state spyware into a fake news story praising the technical capabilities of the person responsible 

for the threats, whose link was sent anonym ously to the profile on the Myspace social network controlled 

by that person. When the person clicked on the link, the program entered his computer and sent 

information (including the user’s real IP address) to investigators, who were then able to establis h that 

he was a former student of the school and arrest him. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets

92 

a certain action —e.g., to carry out a “Coinjoin” or “Chai nhopping” operation —and report to the 

control server the user’s real IP address and other relevant data about the computer, allowing the 

identification and geolocation of these people. This method, known as “Watering hole attack,” was 

the one used in the “ Playpen” case, described above (case § 11). 

339. Also, to enable monitoring of communications made through some of the closed encrypted 

messaging systems that have emerged over the last decade ( e.g., EncroChat or Sky ECC), which 

are used by many major crimina l organizations, European law enforcement agencies have resorted 

to a third variant known as “Supply chain attack,” as detailed above (case § 10). This consists of 

introducing the spyware program into the central servers of the companies providing the 

mess aging service, so that it is distributed via system updates to the devices (cell phones) of all 

network users. 

340. In order to realize any of these variants of the use of spyware for criminal investigation 

purposes, it is essential that the LEAs have the nec essary IT tools to carry it out. To this end, each 

State may choose either to develop them internally (by means of its own specialized human 

resources, who discover the vulnerabilities in the main systems or applications to be intruded and 

design software capable of exploiting them) or to acquire those offered by different private 

companies dedicated to the development and commercialization of spyware for State use. 

341. In this regard, it is important to bear in mind that, when it comes to using spyware in th e

framework of a government investigation, it is necessary to comply with requirements that do not 

apply when the spyware is used for illicit purposes. The first difference is that, unlike 

cybercriminals, LEAs cannot use an “opportunistic” criterion to sel ect their targets (focusing on 

those most vulnerable to a possible attack), but the software tool they use must be able to breach 

the system of specific individuals who are of interest to the investigation. In addition, state 

spyware must guarantee a highe r level of effectiveness than common malware, both in terms of 

obtaining the information sought without alerting the targeted person to the existence of the 

program, and in terms of the reliability of the data obtained, so that it can eventually be present ed 

as evidence in criminal proceedings. 

342. Another issue to consider in the use of spyware by the State is the risk of proliferation, 

understood as the possibility that the computer tools used by LEAs (which generally exploit 

vulnerabilities unknown to the companies that developed the intruded systems or applications, 

and against which there is no defense) fall into the hands of illegal actors, who can then use them 

to perpetrate cybercrime. 155 This is a very specific risk, since the use of spyware always inv olves 

introducing the software tool into someone else’s system, so that —at least until it completes its 

function and self -destructs —it remains in the hands of the person(s) under investigation and not    

> 155 This was the case, for example, with the Wannacry virus used to conduct a massive ransomware attack in May 2017, which was a

93 

in the hands of the state agency that sent it. In order to reduce this risk, the European Parliament 

recommends adopting measures such as the implementation of technical measures to prevent the 

rediscovery of the vulnerability exploited to introduce the spyware; the notification to the 

corresponding (state) au thority of the discovery of a vulnerability and the request for authorization 

to exploit it; and the regulation of the dual use of vulnerabilities; among others. 156 

343. For the same purposes, it is recommended that the state use of spyware be implemented 

with the method known as “dropper/payload.” According to this method, a “dropper” program is 

used as a “launcher,” which is the one that exploits the chosen vulnerability, enables access to the 

system and, once this is achieved, deposits a “payload” specifical ly encrypted for that particular 

target, which includes both the spyware itself (i.e. the one that will collect the information to be 

obtained) and the supporting infrastructure (through which the operation of the spyware and the 

sending of the information to the base is controlled). The “payload” is encrypted as a security 

measure, to ensure that it is not detected and reused by criminals, and so that it can only be 

activated on the system chosen as a target: the “launcher” decrypts it when it manages to get into 

the system. For this purpose, it uses the specific data of the target as a key to encrypt and decrypt 

the “payload.” 157 

344. This separation between the “dropper” program and the one that works as a “payload” also 

allows defenses to control the way in which the prosecution evidence was obtained in an eventual 

judicial process, without increasing the risk of proliferation or comp romising the future usefulness 

of the software tool (as would be the case if its operation were disclosed). In this scenario, the 

“dropper” program, which is the most dangerous in terms of proliferation (because it is the one 

that exploits an unknown vulne rability), is always kept in reserve, since —on the other hand —it does 

not take part in the evidence collection phase. For the latter, the “payload” is used, which is the 

spyware itself. Since the operation of the latter does not require the exploitation of a vulnerability, 

it can be disclosed without compromising its future effectiveness or increasing the risk of 

proliferation. 

345. In order to prove that the interception was carried out legitimately (i.e., in accordance with 

the provisions of the court order) , it is necessary to document all the steps and actions taken to 

introduce the “payload” into the equipment of the subject under investigation. This can be done 

in different ways: filming the entire process, documenting all the steps taken in the log of th e

computer used to carry out the intrusion or in a record, and/or incorporating a testimonial 

statement from the technician detailing the actions taken in compliance with the court order. In 

addition, the characteristics of the program used to carry out th e monitoring and the changes that

> 94

this program must make to the system in order to allow the interception and avoid detection must 

be recorded. This, in order to demonstrate that the evidence has not been destroyed or altered. 

346. In countries where the use o f spyware is not expressly regulated in the procedural 

regulations, the investigative benefits offered by the use of this measure can be reconciled with 

the individual rights of privacy and intimacy potentially affected by it, using the guidelines 

containe d in comparative legislation (see, in this regard, Annex II). Among these, the following are 

worth mentioning: 

• That the judicial authorization specifies: (a) the devices and data or digital content subject 

to the measure; (b) the scope of the measure; an d (c) the manner in which the relevant 

information is to be accessed and collected. 

• That the use of this method be limited only to the investigation of serious crimes. 

• That a certification process be established for the software used, providing for the 

pos sibility of verifying its operation to ensure impartiality and confidentiality. 

• That defense attorneys have the right to obtain the documentation related to the 

investigative measures carried out by means of computer programs and can verify whether 

the pro grams used have been certified. 

• That the obligation to uninstall the programs at the end of their use be established. 

G. Seizure and confiscation of VAs (1): Overview and preparation 

347. The particular characteristics of VAs make their seizure or confiscation , although feasible, 

considerably more difficult than that of tangible assets such as fiat currency. There are multiple 

differences between VAs and physical assets, which have an impact on the manner in which their 

seizure or confiscation should be approac hed. First, a distinction must be made between 

centralized and decentralized VAs. In the first case, to the extent that their operation depends on 

a central administrative authority (the company or entity that developed and operates the 

currency), the VAs are always under the exclusive control of that authority. This facilitates seizure 

or confiscation, since there is an authority that can be the subject of a court order providing for 

the freezing or seizure of the funds. In contrast, in the case of decentr alized currencies (such as 

cryptocurrencies), there is no central bank or similar institution that can freeze the funds pursuant 

to a court order. 

348. Transactions made with most VAs, once finalized, are irreversible. This depends mainly on 

the type of virtua l currency involved. In the case of centralized currencies, the terms and Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets

95 

conditions of use may provide for transactions to be revocable, although they are generally not. 158 

In the case of decentralized currencies, on the other hand, transactions are always irreversible 

once they have been confirmed on the respective Blockchain. 

349. The decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies also determines that any person holding the 

private key can dispose of the funds associated with the VA address corresponding to that key. 

There may be multiple copies of each private key, stored in different places and in different 

formats, and to which different persons may have access. This feature prev ents the adoption of a 

precautionary measure that simply freezes the funds without the need for the authorities to take 

possession of them, such as freezing or seizure, since, as long as the cryptocurrencies are in the 

wallet of the suspected person, even if that person is in custody, any third party with the key can 

irrevocably transfer the VAs to another address. 

350. Nor is it sufficient, for the purposes of securing the VAs, for the State authorities to obtain 

the private key that grants control over the a ddress associated with them, since —as has been 

pointed out —any other person in possession of a copy of the same can transfer them. For the same 

reason, in order to seize VAs, it is not enough to seize the computer or the device where the 

cryptocurrency wal let is hosted, or to make a digital image of it. The only way to safeguard the 

State authorities’ ability to seize VAs is to transfer them to a wallet controlled by them as soon as 

possible, so as to prevent a third party from removing the funds before the y can pass into the 

hands of the State. 

351. In view of the potential complexity of seizures of VAs, and their particular characteristics, 

it is recommended that the agencies that must carry out this type of measures establish 

beforehand internal policies or protocols that regulate the seizure of VAs and their subsequent 

treatment. 159 This should include, as a minimum: 

• The identification of the officials authorized to carry out seizures or transactions with VAs. 

• The details of the internal and external notifications that need to be made when a case 

involves VAs; 

• Standard procedures for collecting and preserving electroni c evidence; and 

• The chain of custody protocols that should govern all devices that may contain electronic 

evidence.

96 

352. The seizure or confiscation of VAs requires considerable prior preparation, beyond the 

process of obtaining the corresponding judicial auth orizations. It consists of three basic stages: (i) 

prior planning of the seizure; (ii) execution of the seizure; and (iii) post -seizure asset 

management. 160 

353. As part of the preparation, it is recommended that, to the extent possible, the type of 

cryptocurre ncies and wallets operated by the person under investigation be determined before 

proceeding. 161 Wallets are the cryptocurrency equivalent of bank accounts. They provide a user -

friendly interface for individuals to receive, store and transfer cryptocurrenci es to others. 162 They 

are, in essence, applications that contain the private keys of one or more VA addresses created by 

the user. With respect to these, the first question to be determined is whether or not the VAs to 

be seized are housed in a custodial wa llet (where the safekeeping of the private keys required to 

transfer the VAs is in charge of a VASP). 

354. If the answer is yes, it is necessary to find out whether the VASP holding the wallet in 

custody is registered and subject to AML/CFT regulation and, if so, under the jurisdiction of which 

country. This is because, once this information is obtained, seizure of the VAs can be achieved by 

means of a court order requiring the VASP to freeze the funds and/or transfer them to an address 

controlled by the state authorities. 

355. On the contrary, if the VAs to be seized are not housed in custodial wallets, the process is 

considerably more difficult, since the management of the funds is not in the hands of a third party 

but of the person under investigation himself ( and possibly also his accomplices). Consequently, 

the only way to carry out the seizure is to find out the private key or the “seed words” that grant 

management over the VAs or the wallet, respectively, in order to be able to transfer them to a 

wallet cont rolled by the State. 

356. There are several different types of wallets in which the keys are not “in custody.” They 

may be virtual wallets (software), both desktop and mobile, or hardware wallets (hardware), in 

which the keys are stored in portable devices suc h as pen drives, or even printed on paper. Among 

virtual wallets, the most common are desktop wallets, which function as applications on a 

computer. There are also online wallets for IOS or Android smartphones, such as Mycelium, 

Greenbits, Breadwallet, and Airbitz. Also, there are hybrid wallets, which are those that are hosted 

on the servers of a third party, but in which the custody of the key remains in the possession of

97 

the VA holder. Finally, there are “multi -signature” wallets, which require the autho rization of more 

than one person to confirm a transaction. 163 

357. The determination of what kind of VA the person under investigation operates with is also 

fundamental for the purposes of seizure and confiscation, since cryptocurrencies can only be 

transferre d to an address corresponding to their own Blockchain. Thus, bitcoins can only be sent 

to a Bitcoin address, moneros to a Monero address, etc. In the course of an asset investigation, 

this information can be obtained in various ways. For example, if a sell er’s activity on an illicit online 

marketplace is investigated, the type of VA accepted as payment is going to be listed in his profile. 

The data can also be obtained through OSINT techniques, Blockchain analysis, etc. In the image 

below, the icons of the main cryptocurrencies are reproduced: 

358. It is also important to be able to recognize the different VA address formats for each 

cryptocurrency. Different features of a VA address , such as numbers, type and distribution of 

characters indicate what type of cryptocurrency is stored in a wallet. In turn, if researchers come 

across an unknown address form, there are tools on the Internet that can be used to find out what 

type of VA it is. The following table deta ils the main characteristics of the most important 

cryptocurrencies. 164

359. There are also certain “best practices” in anticipation of a search that may result in the 

seizure of VAs, 165 which include: 

• Being aware of when the suspected person’s devices have been connected or in use (by 

determining patterns of behavior, network monitoring, surveillance, or undercover action, 

as appropriate). 

• Constant monitoring of the target’s activity and the behavior of their VAs address(es). 

• Prepare for the possibility of encountering accounts that require two -fa ctor 

authentication. 

• To the extent possible, ensure access to fingerprints or other biometric data that would 

allow access to devices protected by such means (e.g., by having the holder of such devices 

in custody or having authorization to arrest the holder during the search and compel the 

opening of the devices). 

360. Given the importance of speed in the seizure of VAs, it is important to obtain judicial 

authorization to carry it out before proceeding with any search that may result in the discovery of 

th e wallet(s) of the person under investigation. 

361. It is also important to request, also beforehand, judicial authorization to seize, in the course 

of the search, all data storage devices that may be found in the home or offices of the suspect 

(removable har d disks, CDRs, DVDRs, memory sticks, pendrives, etc.). This, since they can be 

hardware wallets or contain important information in digital format, such as the “seed words” that

allow reconstructing a VA wallet, the passwords used by the user to access a h ybrid wallet, etc. 

Also, to perform a forensic image and have a specialist analyze the devices for relevant evidence. 166 

362. In particular, it is essential to have judicial authorization so that, in the event that during 

the search of a home —or the arrest of a suspect —it is found that the suspect’s computer or 

smartphone or tablet is unlocked and active, this circumstance can be used to analyze its contents 

in search of VA wallets. This is because the ideal opportunity to seize cryptocurrencies is when 

the wal let containing the private key(s) is open, or when the password to open it or the “seed 

phrase” that allows it to be reconstructed is found during registration. This also prevents future 

access to the content from being hindered by encryption. It should be noted, in this regard, that 

the smartphones and tablets of the main technology companies (Apple and Google) are equipped 

with a security measure that encrypts the entire content when the equipment is locked, by means 

of a cryptographic key linked to the p assword. 

363. Regarding the content of the judicial authorizations linked to the VA seizure proceeding, it 

is also important to bear in mind that in order to prevent any accomplice of the person under 

investigation from transferring the funds to be obtained w hile the procedure is in progress, it is 

essential to isolate that person and all other persons present during the proceedings in order to 

prevent them from connecting to the Internet or making contact with the outside world until the 

seizure has been comp leted. Moreover, the planning of the search must take into consideration 

the need to neutralize, as soon as possible, any possibility that the person under investigation 

destroys, alters, or conceals information useful for accessing the VA wallet (handwrit ten 

passwords or pins, hardware wallets, etc.) transfer its contents, or give notice to a third party to 

do it for him, before the authorities access it. 

364. A final aspect of pre -seizure or confiscation planning is the generation of VA addresses 

controlled by the investigating agency or authority in charge of the proceeding in accordance with 

local law. For this purpose, it is recommended 167 that the public and private keys be generated 

with a wallet application on a computer not connected to the Internet, 168 and then use a Blockchain 

browser to verify that there is no record of the public address on it. Finally, the public key (but not 

the private key) must be transferred from the initial computer to a laptop equipped with the 

necessary applications to perform a VA transfer, which is the one that is going to be taken to the 

procedure to realize the seizure. 

365. It is necessary to bear in mind that each type of cryptocurrency operates with its own 

Blockchain and can only be transferred to a VA address within it, w hich is why it is necessary to

create as many addresses as types of cryptocurrencies to be seized. The same with the wallets, as 

some support multiple VAs, while others are exclusive. 

H. Seizure and confiscation of VAs (2): Relevant evidence or clues in records 

366. In general, but especially when investigating possible ML/TF schemes with VAs, the 

purpose of a search of the property of the person under investigation should not be limited to 

locating physical assets such as trust money, jewelry, automo biles, etc., or paper documentation 

(bank account information, checks, documentation referring to transfers, etc.) for eventual seizure 

or confiscation. On the contrary, investigators should consider the search as a gateway to obtain 

information that leads to the discovery of less obvious elements, but which may be as or more 

useful for the asset investigations that are the subject of this guide. 

367. Indeed, in the course of a search of a property (be it a home, an office or even cars, boats, 

etc.), investiga tors may come across different elements that may be relevant either as evidence, 

as information leading to evidence, or as a key to enable the seizure or confiscation of VAs of illicit 

origin. For instance: 

• Computers or other devices containing information in electronic format, such as cell 

phones, tablets, pen drives, removable hard disks, etc. 

• VA wallets, either in virtual format (such as applications within the aforementioned 

electronic equipment) or in physical format, such as hardware or paper wallets. 

• Information that allows access to the wallets or the transfer of VAs, such as passwords or 

pins to access encrypted wallets or online wallets hosted in external servers, VA addresses 

and —especially —the pr ivate keys or “seed words” that are essential for the seizure of 

decentralized virtual currencies contained in wallets that are not “in custody.” 

368. VA wallets are, in essence, computer applications that store the VA address(es) belonging 

to an individual a nd the public and private keys associated with each address, while facilitating the 

transfer of cryptocurrencies through a simple interface. Virtual wallets can be “desktop” (for 

computers), “mobile” (for smartphones) or online, which are those whose use i s offered as a service 

and are stored “in the cloud” ( i.e., on external servers). These include Armory, Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin 

Knots, Bither, Bitpay, Electrum, Wasabi, Mycelium, among many others. They can be searched on 

Google Apps or Apple’s App Store. Wa llets are generally identified by an icon on the desktop of 

the computer or the home page of the cell phone (see image above, at § 325). Otherwise, they can 

be located by using the computer’s search engine to identify the files with the word “wallet” or a 

“.dat” extension (although in some cases, the user may have saved them with another name or 

extension). Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets

101 

369. There may also be wallets stored on a physical device (“hardware wallets”), such as a 

pendrive. Like virtual wallets, the contents of these are also us ually protected by encryption, 

requiring a password to access the addresses and keys in plaintext format. The fundamental 

difference between physical and virtual wallets is that the former is not connected to the Internet 

(which is why they are known as “c old wallets”), which offers the holder a higher degree of security 

against possible hacking. The most common are KeepKey, Nano Ledger S, and Trezor The image 

below 169 shows one of these hardware wallets. 

370. The “paper” wallets basically consist of doc uments on paper or other material on which 

information can be printed (such as wood or metal), on which the VA address and the public and 

private keys are recorded, either in plaintext format or in the form of a QR code, so that they can 

be “translated” by means of a smartphone or other similar device. The following image shows a 

paper wallet containing both plaintext and QR keys: 

371. The following image, shows a paper wallet with QR codes. 170 On the left is the Bitcoin 

address, on the right the private key:

102 

372. If a paper wallet is discovered, it is possible to verify the existence of funds by scanning 

the QR code and using a mobile application to check it against the information available on the 

Blockchain of the cryptocurrency in question. The same app can be u sed to transfer the VAs to a 

wallet controlled by the authorities, thus making the seizure of the funds a reality. This operation 

is considerably more difficult if the paper wallet is of the encrypted type, such as the one illustrated 

in the following imag e. 171 In such a case, the VAs can only be transferred if the corresponding 

password is available. 

373. VA wallets encountered by investigators during a search are most likely to be protected by 

passwords (to gain access), pins (to enable transactions) or both. It is therefore essential to carefully 

check the place being searched —and, in particular, the environment around the location of the 

person’s computer —for handwritten notes, notebooks, jottings, diaries, sticky notes, etc., in which 

the passwords or pins needed to carry out transactions through such wallets may have been 

entered. Sometimes, passwords can be obtained through computer techniques such as memory 

analysis, 172 interrogation of witnesses who have knowledge of them or through the surreptitious 

installation of “keylogger” spyware. 

374. The essential elements for carrying out cryptocurrency transactions (VA address, public 

key and private key) are relatively large alphanumeric combinations and, therefore, diffic ult to 

memorize. Thus, for example, a person using bitcoins must remember a “private key” consisting of 

a 64 -digit access code, which usually has the following form: 

A5373D44C6D87DC0FA6A6738334369F4553213303DA61F20BD67FC233AA37485

> 2021, p. 23. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the
> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets

103 

375. Given the complexity of the keys in this format, Bitcoin generated an algorithm to simplify 

them (called “Base 58 import format”), converting them into a shorter and simpler cryptographic 

chain, which is the one usually found in the hands of Bitcoin users. However, even so, the 

alphanumeric strings used to operate with this, and other cryptocurrencies are still long, as 

illustrated in the following image: 173 

376. Because of this, VA users are most likely to make a written no te of the passwords and put 

them in a safe place, such as their home, office or cell phone. Therefore, this is where investigators 

should look. 

377. If the person under investigation uses a more sophisticated wallet, such as HD wallets, the 

relevant informati on for use includes a list of between 12 to 36 words in different languages 

(English, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Chinese, French and Italian) that make up a mnemonic (called 

“seed words”/“seed phrase”), containing all the information required to recover th e wallet in case 

of loss, damage to the equipment, etc. A list of “seed words” is illustrated in the following image: 174   

> 173 There is a Bitcoin address first, then a private key reduced with the Base 58 algorithm (private key) and finally a public ke y.

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets

104 

378. If, during the search, the investigators find the “seed words,” they can use them to 

reconstruct the wallet (including its private key) and thus transfer the VAs to a state -controlled 

wallet, thus completing the seizure. The procedure is very simple: the 1 2 or 24 words are 

introduced —for example, in a hardware wallet such as the Ledger —and at the end of the last one, 

an exact copy of the original wallet is obtained. 

379. It is important to keep in mind, however, that not all wallets follow the same protocols. 

Therefore, depending on the type of wallet in question, its reconstruction from the seed phrase 

may yield the same result as if accessing the original (all the VAs contained in it), or an empty 

wallet. 175 There are applications that make it possible to determine what type of result the 

reconstruction of a given wallet by means of the seed phrase will produce. 

380. An additional piece of information, very useful for asset investigations, which may be found 

dur ing a physical search is the “Returning customer number” with which some VA mixers identify 

the persons that use their services more than once, in order to avoid that the illicit cryptocurrencies 

held in reserve are paid twice to the same customer. To this end, after each “mixing,” the customer 

is given a number that must be presented if the mixer’s services are used again, and which is used 

by the platform to determine which VAs not to use in the new mixing process. 176 Finding this 

number, although it does not facilitate the seizure of cryptocurrencies of illicit origin, is useful as 

evidence of the use of mixers, as well as —potentially —to identify the specific mixer that processed

105 

the VAs of the person under investigation and allow an eventual traceability through “Chain 

analysis” techniques. 

I. Seizure and confiscation of VAs (3): Execution 

381. Except in cases where the VAs to be seized are centralized virtual currencies, or 

cryptocurrencies themselves but housed in a custodial wallet (in which case, the meas ure may be 

carried out with the assistance of the central administrative authority of the centralized currency 

or with that of the VASP that holds the VAs in custody), in all other cases the seizure of VAs begins 

with obtaining the private keys, seed words and/or wallets of the person under investigation. 

382. Due to its greater technical difficulty, compared to the seizure of physical assets, it is 

preferable that the measure be carried out by specialized and trained personnel, since, in addition, 

speed may b e essential to ensure the success of the seizure. Therefore, it is necessary for those 

carrying out the measure to be aware of the different varieties of VA wallets that exist and the 

security mechanisms they have, such as hidden sub -wallets or the existen ce of ways to regain 

control of the account after the authorities have taken control of it 177 (for example, through seed 

words). 

383. In view of the existence of such security measures, it should be borne in mind that, in 

practice, the best —and in some cases, perhaps the only —way to carry out the seizure of VAs 

contained in a wallet controlled by the person under investigation is to do so while the wallet is 

unblocked and in use. Otherwise, access to the wallet would probably require the entry of a 

password, a nd its contents would be protected by encryption. 

384. To this effect, it should be ensured, if possible, that the procedure aimed at obtaining 

control over the device containing the wallet is carried out in such a way as to surprise the person 

under investig ation when he/she is using it. Thus, in a notorious case, a suspect’s computer 

(protected by a powerful encryption tool) was hijacked in order to ensure access to its contents in 

plaintext format. 178

Case 14 : Ross Ulbrich. Capture of computing devices while they are in operation: 

The FBI’s arrest of the head of the Silk Road “virtual marketplace” was carefully planned to ensure access 

to his laptop, the contents of which the agency knew were protected by full -disk encryption technology 

when it was at rest. 

To that end, and after l earning that Ulbrich was using the computer at a public library, the FBI dispatched 

two plainclothes agents who created a distraction in the suspect’s vicinity, an opportunity that was seized 

by another agent to take the laptop while it was open and runnin g. Thus, while Ulbrich was being 

detained, the computer was handed over to a specialized technician who was able to start analyzing it 

immediately and access the information contained on it in plaintext format. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the

106 

385. The icons corresponding to a locked an d encrypted (closed padlock) or unlocked and in use 

(open padlock) wallet are illustrated below: 179 

386. If during the search, the intervening agents come across the b locked wallet and are unable 

to find the password required to access it, the device containing it must be seized (as would be 

done with any other device containing relevant digital evidence), adopting the necessary 

precautions established in the protocols on the treatment of electronic evidence. Subsequently, 

and bearing in mind the need to act as quickly as possible, the relevant investigative measures 

should be taken to try to obtain the passwords and seize the VAs associated with it. 

387. If this is not pos sible, because access to the wallet cannot be obtained (or because it is 

found empty once it has been opened), an alternative is the seizure of assets of equivalent value. 180 

For this purpose, the public nature of Blockchains is a key source of information, since it facilitates 

the determination of the precise amount of the substitute funds subject to seizure. This is so, since 

all transactions involving VAs are undoubtedly recorded therein. Therefore, once the address(es) 

of the person subject to the measur e have been identified, the exact amount of the transactions 

carried out by such person, including those made with funds of illicit origin, can be consulted in 

the Blockchain. 

388. If, on the other hand, the wallet is found to be unblocked, the seizure must be carried out 

as soon as possible. Likewise, in such a case —as in any other involving access to digital evidence 

contained in devices that can be blocked or turned off by themselves —it is essential to adopt the 

necessary measures to ensure that they are kep t on and in use, in order to prevent them from 

being blocked again, hindering access to the wallet or protecting the contents by means of 

encryption, as occurred in the case detailed below: 181

107 

389. In addition, agents taking part in the procedure should be aware that a cryptocurrency 

wallet may host multiple addresses (in some cases, even of different cryptocurrencies) containing 

VAs potentially subject to seizure. The image below shows the screen of a wallet (for Windows 

operating system) displaying multiple Bitcoin addresses: 182 

390. Digital files containing virtual wallets (desktop or mobile) must be exported from the device 

of the person under investigation with the help of a computer forensic tool. A digital image of the 

entire wallet must be made, as well as copies or digital im ages (as the case may be) of the private 

keys or seed words found in paper documents or in text or Word files. They should then be 

imported into the computer of the investigative agency that has the necessary software to carry 

out the seizure. 183 

391. The fina l step consists of the actual seizure, which takes place when the VAs are 

transferred from the address of the person under investigation to the one controlled by the

Case 14: “Boucher.” Loss of access to data due to error in the manipulation of a computer: 

Suspect Boucher was apprehended while entering the U.S. from Canada, when a customs agent checked 

the suspect’s laptop, which was turned on and in use, and viewed images of child sexual exploitation on 

the laptop. 

At the ti me of Boucher’s arrest, the computer was seized, at which time the agents in charge turned it 

off. As a result, when it was turned back on to analyze its contents, a protection program was put in 

place that encrypted it in its entirety, preventing access t o it in plaintext format in the absence of the 

password required to disable it. 

In order to carry out the forensic analysis of the content, the U.S. authorities had to request a court 

order to compel the detainee to provide the password, which was initial ly denied on the grounds that it 

violated the prohibition against compulsory self -incrimination. Only on appeal was the requested 

authorization granted. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets

108 

competent authority, for which purpose the computer used by the agents must be connected t o

the Internet and, where appropriate, also synchronized with the corresponding Blockchain. 184 For 

greater efficiency in the realization of the seizure of VAs, it is recommended to adopt a series of 

good practices, including the following: 

• As far as possible, have the state address(es) converted in advance to QR format, in order 

to avoid typing errors (especially if the seizure is conducted with mobile wallets, where it 

is more feasible to make such errors). 

• Otherwise, it is recommended to double, or triple check the destination address 

individually before making the transfer. In this regard, it is worth remembering that 

cryptocurrency transactions are irrevocable, so if VAs are sent to the wrong address, they 

cannot be recovered. 

• It is convenient to use the “sweep” function of VA wallets, which simply transfers the entire 

balance of the wallet being seized to the destination wallet (in this case, the one previously 

set up by the authorities carrying out the seizure). 

• For the purpose of speed, both the FATF and the Council of Europe recommend, in their 

respective guidelines, to set the highest fee that is authorized, in order to ensure that 

Blockchain miners place it in the nearest block and that it is realized more quickly. 

• If state -controlled address es are stored in paper wallets, it is necessary to ensure that the 

private keys are not visible, or that they are multi -signed, in order to reduce the risk of 

theft of seized VAs. 

• In this regard, it is also essential that when the minutes or report on the seizure of VAs are 

drawn up, the private key or the seed phrase that enables their transfer should not be 

recorded in any case. 

• Finally, once the seizure has been completed, the balance of the previously emptied VA 

address(es) should be periodically verif ied, since it may happen that transfers or payments 

are received after the procedure. 

J. Seizure and confiscation of VAs (4): Post -Seizure Treatment 

392. During the post -seizure stage, there are a number of considerations to be made by the 

competent authoritie s in order to decide whether or not to liquidate the seized VAs or convert 

them to fiat currency, such as the need to preserve the value of the cryptocurrencies in custody   

> 184 Refer to: FATF: “Guidance on financial investigations involving virtual assets,” June 2019, p. 29 § 88. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the
> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets
> 109

against fluctuations in their price, or whether there is a legitimate use in the mar ket for the specific 

class of seized VAs. 

393. Broadly speaking, there are two alternatives with respect to the treatment of seized VAs. 

Namely: 

a. Retain them until the final confiscation decision is issued: In this case, once the VAs are 

seized, they are entru sted to the custody of a previously designated authority, which 

administers them until a final decision on their confiscation is made and their liquidation is 

authorized. The advantage of this alternative is that the VAs are only sold once the final 

decisi on on the conviction or acquittal of the accused has been handed down and are 

therefore available if they need to be returned. The disadvantage lies in the risks inherent 

in the maintenance of VAs, and the costs associated with it. 

b. Immediately (or within a short period of time) converting them into fiat currency: In 

contrast to the alternative described above, the advantage of this alternative lies in the 

reduction of the security risks associated with the maintenance of VAs and the costs 

associated with it. The disadvantage lies in the possibility of loss of quotation with respect 

to the time at which they may eventually have to be returned to the accused in the event 

that he/she is found not guilty. At the regional level, the OAS generally recommends, fo r

all seized assets (virtual or physical), to proceed with the anticipated sale and invest the 

resulting funds until the resolution on the merits is issued. 

394. In this context, in some jurisdictions (e.g., the Netherlands), the prior owner of the seized 

VAs (i.e., the person under investigation) is consulted in writing as to whether he/she prefers them 

to be kept in their original state or converted into fiat currency. In this way, if they are to be 

returned at a later date, the State is released from liabil ity for any loss of value resulting from 

fluctuations in the price of the cryptocurrency(ies) in question. 

395. Another alternative is to establish in advance (either through a regulation or written 

internal policies) a fixed term for the conversion of seized VAs into fiat currency (for example, 

three days), so that the decision to carry out such conversion does not depend on a judgment 

about its convenience in economic terms, based on the quotation of the cryptocurrency(ies) in 

question at a given time. 

396. Once the decision to liquidate the seized or confiscated VAs has been taken, and in 

accordance with the provisions of the applicable legislation or the decision of the competent 

authority, the sale may be carried out directly or through a public auction, a lways in an attempt to 

maximize the value obtained. An agreement may also be reached with a private operator 

specialized in the exchange of VAs ( i.e., a VASP) to undertake the conversion of cryptocurrencies 

into fiat currency. In case the competent authori ties do not have a reliable cybersecurity structure Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets

110 

for the storage of VAs, such a VASP may also be entrusted with the administration of the seized 

assets. 

397. Some jurisdictions (such as, for example, the USA) have decided not to liquidate certain 

seized VA s, when they consider that there are no legitimate uses for them in the market. Such is 

the case of “private currencies” such as Monero. In the event that such a decision is made, the 

necessary security measures must be taken to ensure effective permanent storage of the VAs in 

question. 

398. In this regard, it is recommended that the seized VAs be stored in cold storage wallets (e.g., 

a hardware wallet, or a virtual one, but contained in a computer not connected to the Internet, or 

even in paper wallets). 185 Sim ilarly, seized VAs may be stored in multi -signature wallets, so that 

they cannot be stolen by illicitly obtaining a single private key. 

399. It is also recommended that a list of passwords for access to each of the electronic devices 

(including computers and smartphones), encrypted external storage units and seized VA wallets 

be kept in the hands of a specifically designated official, restricting access to them as much as 

possible. Seed phrases, passwords, private keys, pins and VA addresses obtained can be ke pt in 

text files, in a designated folder for each seized VA on an external storage drive (e.g., a removable 

hard drive), if possible encrypted for security. These drives should be kept offline in a specific 

secure location until required by the competent a uthorities to receive or transfer the VAs. 186 

K. Multidisciplinary approach 

400. In view of the constant evolution of ML/TF typologies and the emergence of new 

technologies that facilitate the commission of such crimes, agencies in charge of preventing and 

prosecuting money laundering and terrorist financing need to acquire up -to -date knowledge and 

skills with respect to cybercrime, the anti -forensic technological tools used by criminals and the 

methods and techniques available to counteract t hem. 187 All the more so given the growing 

involvement, worldwide, of criminal organizations in criminal activity in cyberspace (in all its 

variants), which gained remarkable momentum during the global Covid -19 pandemic, as 

highlighted by the FATF in a repor t published in 2020. 188

401. The growing prevalence of cybercrime in recent years (including its ML/TF counterpart, 

crypto -laundering) has forced the LEAs to rethink their organizational and operational structures, 

strengthening units specialized in crimes inv olving the use of ICTs and training in the use of IT 

tools. In such a context, the specific skills required for the effective investigation of this type of 

crime mean that it is not sufficient to relocate existing personnel, even if they are provided with 

additional training: new personnel with such skills, including from the private sector, must be 

brought in. 189 

402. In this regard, the Meeting of Ministers of Justice and Other Ministers and Attorneys 

General of the Americas (REMJA) of the Organization of Amer ican States (OAS) recommends that 

states that have not yet done so establish, as soon as possible, units or entities specifically 

responsible for directing and developing the investigation and prosecution of cybercrime and 

assign them the human, financial, and technical resources necessary to perform their functions in 

an effective, efficient, and timely manner. 

403. In particular, the investigation of criminal behaviors involving VAs requires trained 

investigators who are familiar with the technologies that a llow for the identification, tracing, and 

seizure of such assets. In many cases, the personnel with some of these capabilities are found in 

some of the cybersecurity units existing in the countries of the region, whose operation is generally 

not integrated with that of the units or agencies in charge of investigating ML/TF schemes, with 

or without VAs. 

404. In this regard, the FATF notes that, depending on the specificities of each country, it is 

possible that different agencies or authorities are responsible for conducting asset investigations, 

seizure or confiscation of funds of illicit origin, ML/TF prevention, combating cybercrime and 

computer forensic analysis. Therefore, cooperation among all of them is a fundamental condition 

for the success of criminal investigations and prosecutions concerning these crimes. 190 

405. In this context, organizations such as Interpol, Europol, 191 and UNODC 192 emphasize the 

importance of a multidisciplinary approach in investigations of ML/TF schemes involving VAs. This 

is because they require a combination of traditional investigative techniques and new approaches 

based on ICTs. Thus, agents specialized in ass et investigations can contribute their knowledge of 

financial fraud and accounting or tax crimes, in addition to their knowledge of the activity of 

organized criminal groups, while cybercrime units have relevant knowledge in terms of the use of

112 

advanced te chnological tools and the processing of digital evidence. The synergy between these 

two categories of investigators is essential for the effective prosecution of crypto -laundering, 

which is why the formation of multidisciplinary groups composed of professi onals from both areas 

is strongly recommended. 193 This, in turn, responds to FATF Recommendation 30. 

406. In addition, given that the prosecution of crimes involving the use of VAs requires specific 

knowledge, it is recommended that the agencies responsible fo r investigating this type of illicit 

behavior act in coordination with prosecutors or judicial operators trained in the field, especially 

with regard to the collection, analysis, and processing of electronic evidence and the seizure and 

confiscation of VAs .194 The use of advanced technological investigation techniques or tools, such 

as chain analysis, OSINT, digital undercover agents, and the use of spyware, where their use is 

permitted by local procedural legislation, should also be considered. 

L. Interna tional cooperation 

407. The transnational nature of the Internet and the VA ecosystem makes international 

cooperation an essential element of asset investigations into the criminal behavior associated with 

them. In order for such investigations to yield satisfa ctory results, all channels (formal and informal) 

of collaboration must be used effectively and, above all, in a timely manner. The latter, in view of 

the importance of speed in allowing the preservation of digital evidence, as it is often routinely 

dispos ed of as a result of automated procedures. 

408. In this scenario, it is recommended that the agencies or authorities responsible for 

investigating ML/TF schemes with VAs use all available means to connect with their counterparts 

abroad, 195 including cooperatio n mechanisms between law enforcement agencies (INTERPOL, 

EUROPOL); contact points for the exchange of information related to the seizure and confiscation 

of illicit assets (RRAG, CARIN, ARIN networks, StAR and GFPN); contact points for the exchange 

of info rmation linked to cybercrime ( Inter -American Cybercrime Cooperation Portal and G-7 24/7 

Contact Network); channels for international legal cooperation such as IberRed; networks for the 

exchange of financial intelligence information gathered by FIUs (Egmont Group); as well as 

requests for mutual legal assistance. 

409. The FATF 196 stresses the importance of fully exploiting international cooperation tools 

possible, especially the possibility of requesting digital evidence preservation measures su ch as 

those provided for in the international instruments on cybercrime outlined in § IV.6 of this guide, 

in order to prevent the loss of relevant evidence or the leakage of assets that may be subject to 

confiscation. Although, in contrast to the speed req uired for investigations involving illicit activity         

> 193 Refer to: FATF: “Guidance on financial investigations involving virtual assets,” Jun e2019, p. 17 § 49.
> 194 Refer to: FATF: “Guidance on financial investigations involving virtual assets,” Jun e2019, p. 44 § 150.
> 195 Refer to: FATF: “Guidance on financial investigations involving virtual assets,” June 2019, p. 46 § 156.

113 

in cyberspace, recourse to legal cooperation tools such as mutual legal assistance requests may be 

excessively slow or cumbersome, there are ways to maximize the possible results. In this regard, it 

is re commended that direct contact be established with authorities in the foreign counterpart who 

are familiar with the subject matter of the cooperation request (investigations of illicit activity with 

VAs) and —in general —with the issue of digital evidence, as well as the establishment of informal 

channels of communication with similar agencies in other countries to facilitate collaboration. 

410. With regard to the subject matter of this guide, the RRAG is a fundamental tool for 

identifying assets and persons abr oad that may be relevant in the framework of an investigation 

into ML/TF schemes using VAs and for learning about criminal proceedings underway in other 

countries. To this end, general, social, tax, property and financial data may be requested through 

the network’s secure platform, either to enrich the information available to investigators in the 

requesting country, or to facilitate the preparation of requests for international legal assistance 

with accurate data, thus increasing the chances of success. 

411. In this regard, the RRAG currently has 48 contact points from twenty -two (22) countries 

with direct access to the secure RRAG platform from prosecutors’ offices, police, FIU, and other 

law enforcement authorities. This platform allows for the exchange of i nformation between RRAG 

countries and the 54 jurisdictions belonging to the CARIN Network. In addition, RRAG contact 

points can access information held by other international organizations involved in asset 

confiscation, such as the Camden Asset Recovery I nter -Agency Network (CARIN), the Global Asset 

Recovery Focal Point Network (GFPN), and Interpol’s Stolen Asset Recovery (StAR) Initiative. In 

addition, information collected by ARIN networks around the world, including the Asset Recovery 

Inter -Agency Netwo rk for Asia Pacific (ARIN -AP) and West and Central Asia (ARIN -WCA), the 

Caribbean Asset Recovery Inter -Agency Network (ARIN -CARIB), the Asset Recovery Inter -Agency 

Network for Eastern Africa (ARIN -EA), Southern Africa (ARIN -SA) and West Africa (ARIN -WA) ca n

also be accessed through this channel. 197 

412. Moreover, within the OAS, the Technical Secretariat of the Meeting of Ministers of Justice 

and Other Ministers and Attorneys General of the Americas (REMJA) is in charge of the Inter -

American Cooperation Portal on Cyber -Crime, created in 1999, whose purposes are to strengthen 

international cooperation in the prevention, investigation, and prosecution of cyber -crime; 

facilitate the exchange of information and experiences among it s members; and make the 

necessary recommendations to improve and strengthen cooperation among OAS member states 

and with international organizations and mechanisms. 

413. In turn, the REMJA Technical Secretariat (Department of Legal Cooperation of the 

Secretar iat for Legal Affairs of the OAS) maintains an updated directory of criminal prosecution  

> 197 Refer to: RRAG/GAFILAT: “Inventory of existing global networks for the identification and recovery of proceeds of crime,” Jun e
> 2021. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the
> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets

114 

and police authorities that serve as contact points for international cooperation on cybercrime and 

electronic evidence. 

414. With regard to international cooperation on cybercrime (including crypto -laundering 

through VAs), the REMJA recommended that member countries strengthen mechanisms for 

information exchange and cooperation with other international organizations and agencies in the 

area of cybercrime, s uch as the United Nations, the Council of Europe, the European Union, the 

Asia -Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 

Development (OECD), the G -7, the Commonwealth and INTERPOL, so that OAS Member States 

can take advantage of developments in those areas. States that have not yet done so were also 

urged to join the G -7 “24/7 High Tech Crime Contact Network” as soon as possible. 

415. In this regard, REMJA XI concluded that the new information and communication 

technolog ies (ICTs) are useful tools for strengthening international legal cooperation in the various 

branches of law and are ideal means for facilitating the establishment by states of mechanisms for 

contact, collaboration, and coordination among the various autho rities responsible for processing 

requests for legal cooperation and mutual assistance in the various areas of law. Accordingly, it 

was recommended that the member states adopt the necessary measures to promote the use of 

new ICTs, such as the electronic p rocessing of mutual legal assistance requests, including the 

acceptance of official documents with electronic or digital signatures, and videoconferencing, in a 

secure and responsible manner, to make international legal cooperation in the Americas more 

eff ective, efficient, and expeditious. 

M. Education and training 

416. Investigating the illicit use of VAs involves the analysis of complex technologies and, 

therefore, requires the development of novel investigative techniques and the acquisition of new 

resource s and capabilities. Given that illicit actors generally tend to adapt to a changing context 

faster than the authorities, it is essential to take the necessary steps for LEAs to acquire the 

required levels of competence to successfully investigate the explo itation of VAs for criminal 

purposes. 198 

417. To this end, it is necessary to implement training programs aimed at the widest possible 

range of personnel, so that they acquire the minimum knowledge necessary to carry out —or at 

least, not compromise —asset inves tigations referring to the illicit use of VAs.  

> 198 Refer to: C ouncil of Europe: “Guide on seizing cryptocurrencies,” Cybercrime Programme Office of the Council of Europe, February
> 2021, p. 64. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the
> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets

115 

418. In such context, there are three categories of training relevant to procure the adaptation 

of LEAs to the new technological scenario. 199 Namely: 

a. Training for investigators regarding the new technologies invol ved in asset investigations 

on the illegal use of VAs. 

b. Training for police officers in general on how to recognize and react to the existence of 

digital evidence relevant to those kinds of investigations; and 

c. Training for forensic investigators regarding t he new technologies involved. 

419. With regard to the first category, while not all investigative personnel need to specialize in 

the use of VAs, it is necessary to have a number of experts (proportional to the size of the 

jurisdiction) who are trained to reco nstruct a chain of transactions on the Blockchain and/or to 

seize or confiscate VAs. Other personnel should only have the minimum knowledge necessary to 

recognize clues about the possible use of cryptocurrencies if they come across them in the course 

of an investigation or when conducting a search, as well as be aware of how to contact specialized 

law enforcement officers within their jurisdiction. 200 

420. In this context, it is important that a sufficient number of agents receive training in the use 

of forensi c tools for traceability of VAs that are available on the market or, alternatively, those 

developed internally by each country, if it decides to do so. 201 This, since the participation of agents 

lacking adequate preparation in these tasks generates the risk of misinterpreting the information 

available in the Blockchain, which may lead to pursuing false leads or overlooking really relevant 

data. 202 

421. Similarly, it is vital that the seizure of VAs be carried out by specialized personnel, to avoid 

errors that could lead to the loss of funds. Therefore, the relevant authorities (be they police 

agencies or competent prosecutors’ offices) must be trained to handle the different types of VA 

wallets that may be used in these procedures, as well as the cybersecu rity issues inherent to the 

management of the seized assets. 

422. Notwithstanding the above, in view of the possibility that agents not belonging to 

specialized units may come across cryptocurrencies in compliance with search warrants, etc., it is 

necessary th at LEA personnel who may potentially find themselves in such a situation know how 

to recognize at least the most important features of the use of VAs (QR codes, seed phrases, public

or private keys, different cryptocurrency address formats and different ty pes of wallets, 

passwords, pins, etc.). 203 Also, on a more general level, they should be able to recognize devices 

that may contain digital evidence. 204 

423. The actions aimed at providing this training are varied, including the organization of training 

programs , the preparation of handbooks, exchange programs and/or participation in international 

conferences or seminars. In this direction, and in order to expand as much as possible the scope 

of knowledge on VAs among law enforcement personnel, it is advisable to distribute reference 

material (brochures, instructions) containing detailed pages or applications related to VAs, 

exchange platforms, payment processors, and cryptocurrency wallet service providers, images of 

seed phrases, QR codes, paper or hardware wall ets and VA ATMs, etc. 

424. Finally, the implementation of instances of public -private cooperation with private sector 

actors specialized in these new technologies is also recommended, aimed at ensuring that the LEAs 

and public prosecutor units with competence in the field are kept up to date with respect to new 

developments in this area. 205

# ANNEX I: GUIDELINES FOR INVESTIGATION, IDENTIFICATION, SEIZURE, 

# AND CONFISCATION OF VIRTUAL ASSETS 

A. BASIC CONCEPTS 

1. Virtual Asset (VA): As defined by the FATF, a digital representation of value that can be 

digitally exchanged or transferred and used as a form of payment or investment instrument. VAs 

do not include digital representations of fiat currency, securities, and other financial a ssets that 

are already covered elsewhere in the standards. 

2. Fiat money: It refers to real (non -virtual) currency or money, or national currency. It differs 

from virtual currency in that it functions as the currency and paper money of a country, designated 

as legal tender; it circulates, is used, and accepted as a means of exchange in the country of 

issuance. 

3. Cryptocurrencies: These are open source, convertible and decentralized VAs that operate 

in a distributed peer -to -peer network that applies mathematic al and cryptographic principles to 

provide security to the system. Transfers between users are carried out “peer -to -peer,” without 

intermediaries, based on a set of public and private cryptographic keys, and require cryptographic 

signature to be completed. The transparency of the system is ensured by the recording of 

transactions in a sort of distributed “ledger” (called Blockchain in most cryptocurrencies), 

maintained by a network of mutually “untrusted” parties (called “miners” in the Bitcoin and other 

cr yptocurrencies ecosystem) that elaborate the cryptographic blocks of the chain and are 

rewarded for it with fees paid by the users. 

Icons of the main cryptocurrencies: 

4. Bitcoin: Launched in 2009, it was the first decentralized convertible VA, and the first 

cryptocurrency. Bitcoins are account units composed of unique alphanumeric sequences that 

constitute units of currency (divisible, in turn, into smaller units, called Satoshis) and Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets
> 119

have value only because individual users are willing to pay for them. Bitcoins are traded digitally 

between users in a partially anonymous form (the persons or entities involved in each transaction 

are identified only by alphanumeric pseudonyms called “Bitcoin addresses”) and can be exchanged 

for fi at currency or other cryptocurrencies. The software required to send, receive, and store 

bitcoins or to monitor transactions can be downloaded free of charge. Users can also obtain their 

Bitcoin addresses (which function as accounts) from Bitcoin exchange platforms or online wallet 

services. Transactions (flows of funds) are recorded in a shared public registry (the “blockchain”), 

where they are identified by Bitcoin addresses. 

5. VA or cryptocurrency address ( e.g., Bitcoin address): It is an alphanumeric cod e that 

identifies the virtual location associated with a certain amount of VAs, necessary to be able to 

send or receive cryptocurrencies. It works like a bank account in the traditional financial system to 

receive or send transfers . For example, Bitcoin ad dresses are between 26 and 32 characters long. 

They start with the number 1 for  standard addresses  and number 3 for  multi -signature addresses .

Other cryptocurrencies have their own systems for representing their addresses. VA addresses 

can also be represented by means of QR codes. 

6. Bloc kchain: It is a form of registry or “ledger” used by Bitcoin and most cryptocurrencies 

and works by chaining together blocks of data. Each of these blocks contains information about 

the transaction being carried out. The initial and final elements of the b lock are related, 

respectively, to the previous and next block. Thus, modification of the block would corrupt the 

entire chain, although it is practically impossible to alter it. In addition, blockchain -based 

technology works in a distributed fashion, with multiple computers operating simultaneously with 

the chain, which makes it extremely difficult to compromise it through a computer attack. Each 

cryptocurrency has its own Blockchain. 

7. Private key: It is a random number that functions as a secret key, gene rated through an 

asymmetric cryptographic process, and is used to safeguard the ownership and management of 

cryptocurrencies. During the process of creating a VA wallet, first the private key is generated and 

then, from it, the public key, which is mathema tically related to the former. The process, however, 

is impossible to realize in reverse (deducting the private key from the public one), providing a high 

level of security. The private key is the one that assigns to the holder the control of the funds 

ass ociated with a given VA address. 

8. Cryptocurrency Wallets: Software applications that allow interacting with the VA 

Blockchain in order to generate and/or store cryptocurrency addresses and their corresponding 

public/private key sets. It is an interface t hat allows users to manage, transfer, or receive VAs. 

There are several types of VA wallets. 

9. Hosted / Custodial wallets: These are virtual wallets that are hosted on an external server 

(i.e., in “the cloud”), and are offered through VA wallet service pro viders. The name Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets
> 120

refers to the fact that the private keys are not held by VA holders, but “in custody” of the service 

provider. 

10. Self -custody/ Self -hosted wallets: These are the wallets that cryptocurrency users 

themselves keep in their possession, for th eir own use of the VAs associated with the addresses 

stored in them. These wallets may be virtual or hardware wallets. 

11. Software wallets: These are downloadable desktop or mobile applications that can be kept 

on a desktop computer or on a mobile device (s martphone) to enable secure storage of keys on 

the device. 

12. Hardware wallets: Wallet applications hosted on physical devices such as pen drives or 

USB, which allow the user to store his/her keys offline, on portable physical devices such as pen 

drives. 

13. Pa per wallets: These are sheets of paper or other material on which the cryptocurrency 

addresses, and the set of public/private keys used to manage the exchange of cryptocurrencies 

are printed, either in plaintext format or in the form of a QR code, by means of a VA wallet program. 

They are used for the storage and safekeeping of funds that will not be used or moved for a long 

time, since they offer a higher level of security, as they are not susceptible to cyber theft. 

14. “Seed words” or “Seed phrase”: They ar e used by many VA wallet applications to generate 

private keys from a single “seed,” which takes the form of a mnemonic consisting of a sequence of 

between 12 and 24 words in different languages (English, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Chinese, 

French, and Ita lian), which function as a backup for the wallet, allowing that in case of loss of 

control over the wallet (for example, due to theft, loss or technical malfunction of the device in 

which it is stored), it is possible to recreate it by entering the words i n the order originally provided 

in the corresponding application. 

15. Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs): As defined by the FATF, comprises any natural or 

legal person not covered elsewhere under the Recommendations who, as a business, carries out 

one or more of the following activities or transactions for/on behalf of another natural or legal 

person: 

a. Exchange between virtual assets and fiat currency. 

b. Exchange between one or more forms of VAs. 

c. Transfer of VAs. 

d. Custody or administration of VAs or instruments that allow controlling VAs; and Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets
> 121

e. Participation in, and provision of financial services in connec tion with an issuer’s offering 

or sale of a VA. 

16. VA/cryptocurrency exchange platforms (cryptocurrency exchanges): These are those 

operated by persons or entities commercially engaged in the exchange of cryptocurrencies for fiat 

currency, funds, precious me tals, or other cryptocurrencies (or vice versa), in exchange for a fee 

(commission). They generally accept a wide variety of payment methods (cash, wire transfers, 

credit cards or other cryptocurrencies) and are used to deposit or withdraw funds from VA 

ac counts. They are included in the FATF definition of VASP. 

17. Mixers: These are platforms that offer cryptocurrency users the possibility of obscuring 

the transaction chain in the Blockchain through the use of anonymity software tools that link 

multiple tran sactions to a single VA address and send them together in a way that makes them 

appear to come from a different address. The mixer or tumbler intervenes when it receives an 

instruction from the customer to send funds to a certain address. In order to conce al the origin 

and destination of the transaction, the mixer combines it with a complex and semi -random series 

of fictitious transactions, so as to prevent the transfer to the final destination from being 

associated with the address of origin. 

18. TOR (The On ion Router): It is a distributed network of computers on the Internet that is 

used to conceal the real IP addresses (and therefore the true identity) of users by routing 

communications through multiple nodes (randomly chosen for each communication) around the 

world and shielding the data packets indicating the origin and destination of the communication in 

several layers of encryption. 

19. Hidden services: These are web pages located on the “dark web,” which can only be 

accessed through the use of anonymous co mmunication systems such as TOR. This prevents their 

true location (IP address) from being identified, since they are masked by the “layered” routing 

provided by TOR. Communication between these sites and their users takes place through a 

“rendezvous point ” that provides an additional layer of protection against traffic analysis. 

20. Encryption: It is a data encryption method that consists of encoding the contents using a 

mathematical formula or algorithm that disorganizes them, so that if the corresponding ke y (called 

a “cryptographic key”) is not available, they look like a set of alphanumeric characters with no 

meaning or reading logic. 

21. Blockchain analysis: It is the process of inspection, identification, segmentation, and 

modeling for the visual representa tion of the public data contained in the Blockchain, in order to 

obtain useful information about those who carry out transactions with cryptocurrencies. This 

analysis is usually carried out by private companies that use proprietary algorithms to map the 

tr ansactions carried out by cryptocurrency users and link them to each other. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets
> 122

22. Open -Source Intelligence (OSINT): A term that refers to the systematic collection, 

processing, and analysis of open access information. That is: information available to the gener al 

public without restrictions (on social networks, websites, search engines, news portals, public 

records, etc.). 

23. Spyware: It is a type of malware (malicious program) designed to operate surreptitiously 

within a computer system and secretly record information. It can monitor and copy what 

is typed (“keylogger”), what enters or leaves the system, capture stored information, or 

even activate the computer’s microphones or cameras. 

24. Electronic (or digital) evidence: Information generated, stored, or transmitted by means of 

electronic devices that may be used as evidence in court. 

B. INVESTIGATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF VIRTUAL ASSET S

25. Agencies responsible for conducting asset investigations on ML/TF schemes with VAs 

should have at their disposal the widest possible range of information, whether from their own 

sources, from exchanges with other national authorities, or from cooperation with third parties 

(e.g., in the private sphere). The information should include: 

• Information collected by LEAs on persons under investigation for the suspected illicit 

activity on the Dark Web; identification of their pseudonyms or aliases; addresses o f

known cryptocurrencies or accomplices (and their pseudonyms or aliases); prior arrests or 

convictions; physical or electronic addresses, telephone numbers or email addresses that 

they may have used in connection with criminal activity. 

• Information coming from the reporting institutions under the AML/CFT obligations, 

including information from suspicious transaction reports (STRs), as well as information 

obtained within the framework of know -your -customer (KYC) policies. This includes 

records of transactio ns carried out through VASPs, or of VASPs with traditional financial 

entities, or any other asset activity that may generate suspicions of the possible use of VAs 

to recycle funds of illicit origin. 

• Information from regulatory bodies such as central banks, tax authorities, securities, or 

insurance regulators, etc. 

• Information from open sources, including data such as the price of different 

cryptocurrencies, contact information or VASPs data, or links between the persons under 

investigation and potential id entifying information (cryptocurrency addresses, wallets, links 

to criminal activity or criminals, etc.). Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets

• Information held by national units specialized in cybersecurity, including reports on 

incidents involving the financial sector; information on malware aimed at identity theft or 

unauthorized collection of confidential and/or financial information (including data or 

programs used for VA management); and intelligence on the hacker community or on 

cybersecurity threats. 

26. For the purposes of collecting info rmation on persons under investigation who have 

activity or nexus with other persons of interest outside their borders, GAFILAT member country 

investigative agencies may consult the list of open sources in member countries compiled by the 

RRAG. 

27. Special a ttention should be paid to the links between the possible illicit use of VAs for 

ML/TF and VASPs, through which the exchange between VAs and fiat currency usually takes 

place, since this is the vulnerability of any ML/TF scheme involving such assets, espec ially when 

significant amounts are involved, given that the (relatively) small nature of the cryptocurrency 

markets makes it more sensitive to massive inflows or outflows of funds. 

28. Countries that have not yet done so should adapt their domestic regulations in order to 

impose registration and AML/CFT compliance obligations on VASPs, in accordance with the 

provisions of the new FATF Recommendation 15. 

29. It should be borne in mind that VASPs that are subject to compliance with AML/CFT 

obligations con stitute a source of information of great importance for ML/TF investigations with 

AML/CFT (since they can connect pseudo -anonymous transactions with VAs with identified 

customers) and, in addition, can facilitate the freezing, seizure, and confiscation of funds involved 

in or derived from illicit behaviors. 

30. The STRs submitted by VASPs are very useful for the asset investigations covered by this 

guide, since they contain both information on transactions (issuing customer, beneficiary, 

addresses of the customer’s wallets, balance in the wallets, date and time of the transactions, type 

of VA transferred, location of the transfer, canceled transactions, bank accounts registered or 

verified, and type of devices used); as well as customer information (name, user identification, IP 

address, physical billing address, e -mail address, date of birth, nationality, citizenship, economic 

profile and commercial activity). 

31. For the detection of possible ML/TF schemes with VAs by means of VASPs, the “red flags” 

outlined in the FATF report on “Warning signs of money laundering and terrorist financing with 

virtual assets,” published in 2020, should be taken as a reference. 

32. Investigative agencies should pay particular attention to the activity of unregistered 

VASPs, or th ose that conceal their true location in order to circumvent locally Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets
> 124

established AML/CFT compliance regulations, as such actors in the VA ecosystem often process 

a high percentage of illicitly sourced VA transactions. 

33. In particular, the actions of mixers, tumblers, and online bookmakers operating outside the 

law should be investigated. In this regard, investigations related to the use of VAs should aim not 

only to identify and prosecute persons who exploit the use of cryptocurrencies to carry out 

criminal a ctivities, but also to prosecute and eventually stop the activity of VASPs or other service 

providers when such activity is aimed at favoring or facilitating criminal operations. 

34. It is important to keep in mind that, in general, criminal activity with VAs is concentrated 

in a few VASPs that facilitate the commission of ML/TF operations with cryptoassets. Therefore, 

if it is discovered which VASPs receive the highest volume of transactions with illicitly sourced 

VAs, investigations focused on them are more likely to generate positive results in terms of 

identification of persons involved in criminal conduct and seizure and confiscation of VAs. 

35. It should be noted that the exchange between VAs and fiat currency can also be carried 

out through P2P exchange pl atforms, which are not covered by AML/CFT regulations in 

accordance with FATF Recommendation 15. Although, for the time being, such platforms process 

a low percentage of transactions with illicitly sourced VAs, operations that make it difficult to trace 

VA s and mask its origin, such as “chain hopping” or “coinjoin,” can be carried out through them. 

36. Investigative agencies should be vigilant about the possible use, by the persons under 

investigation, of cryptocurrency kiosks or “Bitcoin ATMs” for the exchan ge of VAs and fiat 

currency. In this regard, it should be borne in mind that companies operating such ATMs fall under 

the FATF definition of VASP, so they are required to obtain information about their customers and 

report transactions considered suspiciou s. 

37. The location of the ATMs allegedly used by the persons under investigation can be taken 

as a starting point for surveillance or monitoring of that person or his possible accomplices, either 

physically or by electronic means. 

38. If the surveillance of th e VA ATM makes it possible to determine the precise date and time 

of an exchange transaction carried out by the person under investigation, that data can be used to 

request information from the company responsible for that transaction, including the amount , the 

type of cryptocurrency traded, and the VA addresses of the participants. From this, a

reconstruction of the origin and destination of the VAs involved can be performed. 

39. For the purpose of tracing the origin and destination of VAs allegedly associat ed with illicit 

activity, the Blockchain offers an important source of information that is both relevant and reliable 

(since the decentralized structure of cryptocurrencies prevents the alteration of the records in the 

Blockchain). Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets
> 125

Virtual asset tracking 

40. From the data recorded in the Blockchain, investigative agencies can learn the complete 

transaction history of a given VA address, including the addresses of all the users with whom it 

carried out transactions and the date, time, and exact amount transfer red (which can be useful as 

a search criterion when analyzing many transactions simultaneously); as well as the complete chain 

of transactions made by each VA since its creation and the IP addresses associated with each VA 

address (unless the user connects to the network through an anonymity tool such as a VPN or 

TOR system). 

41. The analysis of this dataset, and its cross -checking with information obtained from other 

sources (especially if carried out by means of “Big data” IT tools) can be crucial to detect criminal 

activity with VAs, identify its perpetrators and obtain incriminating evidence. In this regard, the 

possibility of tracing the movements of VAs from and to a VASP is of particular relevance. If the 

VASP is registered in a jurisdiction that impose s AML/CFT obligations, it is likely to have 

information that allows the identification of the users involved in transactions with VAs. 

42. For the purposes of present or future identification of persons under investigation for 

suspected illegal activity with VAs, it is important to register, sort, and categorize all VA addresses 

of cryptocurrency exchange platforms, mixers, online bookmakers, illicit markets on the dark web, 

persons already identified as likely suspects of engaging in illicit fund -generating activity, or 

ML/TF, among others, that have been identified in the course of investigations. 

43. Investigative agencies should have as broa d a base as possible of VA addresses with 

identified holders, as this facilitates the use of the Blockchain to allow the identification of other 

users who have contact with them. 

Tools or techniques that can be used to identify virtual assets and related transactions 

(i) Blockchain analysis 

44. Blockchain analysis (or “Chain analysis”) requires the use of the appropriate technological 

tools, in addition to the necessary technical knowledge to use them. 

45. One tool that can be found in open -source versions fr eely available on the Internet are 

Blockchain explorers, network applications that operate as search engines in the VA ecosystem, 

allowing to locate addresses, transactions and other data linked to them. 

46. There are also more sophisticated computer resourc es, specifically designed for the needs 

of investigative agencies, in the hands of private companies specialized in Blockchain analysis. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets
> 126

CARIN and other international organizations recommend the establishment of public -private 

cooperation instances by cont racting the services of these companies, which have proven to be 

effective in asset investigations on ML/TF schemes with VAs. 

47. In the latter case, it is necessary that authorities have agents or officials prepared to explain 

the findings of these companie s in the framework of the judicial proceedings that take place in 

connection with the criminal behavior with VAs under investigation. In this regard, it is 

recommended that a good working relationship be maintained with the personnel of the 

companies provi ding the service, especially if they may be called upon to testify on how the 

findings presented were arrived at. 

48. The information obtained from the Blockchain analysis can be complemented with “ Open -

Source Intelligence” (OSINT) techniques, which involve t he systematic collection, processing and 

analysis of information available to the general public, without restrictions. 

(ii) OSINT 

49. In the context of asset investigations under this guide, OSINT can be used, for example, to 

obtain data on the holders of VA addresses already known to the investigators. To this end, 

attempts can be made to place the VA address in Internet search engines, as it is quite common 

for individuals engaged in illicit online trading (or terrorist organizations seeking to raise funds 

through VAs) to post their address (associating it with their online profile and pseudonym) in 

forums (such as Reddit, 4Chan, and 8Chan) or in the comments sections of specialized 

cryptocurrency or IT websites. In addition, websites specifical ly dedicated to the identification of 

VA users and the addresses associated with them, such as walletexplorer.com, can be consulted. 

50. The same technique can be used to obtain information on the Dark Web, where there are 

multiple forums (Dread, Darknet Avengers, The Hub, Exploit.in) in which, taking advantage of the 

anonymity conferred by TOR login, people freely share information on hidden services, including 

their addresses, the products and services they offer, comments on the quality of the s ervice, 

nicknames of the most (or least) successful traders, etc. 

51. Secondly, it should be borne in mind that online pseudonyms often have a correlate either 

on the surface web (when the individual acts mostly on the dark web) or even in real life, which —

if discovered —may allow linking the illicit activity to his or her real identity. In such a context, 

investigators can take advantage of mistakes that people often make when splitting their online 

identity from their real -life (secret) identity, such as not remembering to use anonymous surfing 

tools at some point, using the same VA address for illicit and licit activities, or using an e -mail 

address associated with their real name in connection with their online identity. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets
> 127

52. OSINT techniques can also be effecti ve in obtaining information on unregistered VASPs 

providing services to persons engaged in illicit conduct with VAs, including mixers or P2P 

cryptocurrency exchange platforms, whether on the surface web or on the dark web, since they 

operate on the same re putation -based system as illegal online marketplaces. 

53. In addition, OSINT techniques can be used to gather information that would allow to link 

persons suspected of being involved in illicit conduct generating funds with the suspected 

launderers of such fu nds. Finally, open -source information may be useful to better understand the 

lifestyle, the assets of the suspect, or the places where he/she resides or carries out his/her 

commercial or social activity. 

54. It is also possible to obtain already processed inf ormation on persons of interest or 

suspected of being involved in illegal activities with VAs by resorting to the services of the so -

called “Data brokers,” which are companies dedicated to the collection and processing of 

information from multiple sources and the elaboration of detailed personal profiles. 

55. In order to improve the effectiveness of asset investigations, it is recommended to combine 

the techniques described above with the use of traditional investigative measures, such as physical 

surveillance , inspection of waste discarded by the persons of interest, requests for reports, 

production orders and/or personal or house searches. Also, the questioning of witnesses, who can 

provide valuable insights into the lifestyle, activities and assets of suspec ts. 

56. In this context, electronic means of surveillance can be used to obtain data relevant to 

investigations into unlawful behaviors involving VAs, such as the suspected person’s connections 

to cryptocurrency exchange platforms, mixers, online gambling sit es, P2P networks dedicated to 

the transfer of VAs, or cloud storage services. Similarly, the type of computing devices used by the 

persons under investigation, whether they have one or more online wallets, preferred methods of 

communication or whether they use public Wi -Fi connections or other electronic means that can 

be accessed by the authorities can also be ascertained in this way. 

(iii) Network monitoring tools 

57. Network monitoring software tools can be used for this purpose. These tools make it easy 

to obtain relevant information in different formats: large digital documents, images, audio files, 

videos and even telephone communications over the Internet. Even if the content of the 

intercepted communications is encrypted, it will be possible to capture the so -called “wrapper 

data,” i.e. all those that do not form part of the content of the communication, but refer to the 

mechanisms for its execution (source and destination IP addresses, data volume, Internet nodes 

involved in the exchange of data packet s, etc.). Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets
> 128

58. The use of technological tools also facilitates the tracking of persons under investigation, 

either through the installation of GPS devices or by exploiting data from mobile applications on 

“smartphones” (for navigation, social media, online sh opping or banking, etc.), associated with the 

GPS embedded in the cell phones themselves. In addition, prospective or retrospective monitoring 

can be carried out on the basis of the information that telecommunications companies collect as a 

result of the c onstant contact between cell phones and cell phone towers, linked to 3G or 4G 

operation. 

(iv) Forensic analysis 

59. In order to identify relevant information or evidence for ML/TF investigations with VAs, a 

forensic analysis of electronic devices owned by ( or used by) the person under investigation is 

recommended. In this regard, evidence or information of interest may be found in desktop 

computers, laptops, tablets, smartphones, smart readers, portable GPS equipment, digital cameras, 

flash memories, SD card s, pen drives, removable hard disks, external servers in the “cloud;” 

compact disks and in smart devices included in the so -called “Internet of Things.” 

60. The important information or evidence that can be found in such devices includes: 

• Evidence or indications of VAs use. 

• Evidence or indications of contacts with cryptocurrency exchange platforms (either VASP 

or P2P platforms), mixers, online gambling sites , etc. 

• Evidence or indications of use of cloud storage services. 

• Evidence or indications of the use of anonymity tools (TOR, I2P, VPNs). 

• Evidence or indications of the use of encryption tools. 

• Keys or passwords to access information stored in the cloud or to disable encryption. 

• Evidence or indications of communications with other suspicious persons (holders of funds 

of illicit origin, terrorist organizations, money launderers, etc.). 

• Property documentation or other relevant evidence in digital format (compa ny 

incorporation documents, accounting records, images or data on assets, agendas, etc.). 

Special investigative techniques 

61. When the characteristics of the operation under investigation so require (due to its 

complexity or the difficulty of obtaining rele vant information or evidence by traditional means), Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets
> 129

the use of special investigative techniques such as undercover actions may be used, always within 

the framework of the procedural legislation in force in each country. 

62. In this regard, it is possible to take advantage of the evasive programs and techniques used 

by criminals to anonymously carry out their criminal activities in cyberspace (such as the use of 

tools like TOR or VPNs to surf the Internet anonymously, or the assumption of alternative 

identitie s on the Internet) to infiltrate LEA agents within criminal organizations operating in 

cyberspace, or to interact with persons offering illegal goods or services on the Internet. 

63. In these cases, given that Blockchain analysis tools can also be used by cr iminals, it is 

recommended to previously generate a transaction history related to the “profile” to be assumed 

by the agent who intends to act covertly on the Internet by carrying out transactions with VAs. 

Use of spyware 

64. Another advanced investigative technique that may be used in the context of complex 

ML/TF investigations involving VAs is the use of spyware or “Trojans” by LEAs. Another advanced 

investigative technique that may be used in the context of complex ML/TF investigations involving 

VAs is th e use of spyware or “Trojans” by LEAs. This tool can be used to remotely access 

information or digital evidence whose physical location is unknown or impossible to access 

effectively (for example, to obtain the passwords needed to access the contents of en crypted 

documents, or information stored on external servers); to monitor communications made over the 

Internet, using communication technologies that make interception by traditional means 

impossible (VoIP or encrypted messaging systems); to carry out aco ustic or audiovisual 

surveillance, using the spyware to remotely enable microphones or cameras of devices in 

possession of (or in the vicinity of) the persons under investigation; or to locate or follow in real 

time the persons under investigation. 

65. The i mplementation of state use of spyware requires three stages: (i) analysis of the target’s 

use of the networks, to determine which platforms or applications he/she uses (and the possible 

vulnerabilities of such platforms or applications that can be exploited to enter the system); (ii) 

compromise of the platform through the most appropriate “exploit,” in order to introduce the 

spyware; and (iii) monitoring of the information captured from the target. 

66. The computer tools necessary for the use of spyware for investigative purposes can be 

obtained through the State’s own technological development, or by acquiring the programs 

offered by private companies dedicated to the development and commercialization o f spyware for 

State use. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets
> 130

Challenges related to the use of spyware 

67. In order to reduce the risk of proliferation inherent in the use of spyware, it is 

recommended to adopt mitigating measures such as the implementation of technical measures to 

prevent the rediscovery of the vulnerability to introduce the spyware; the notification to the 

corresponding (state) authority of the discovery of a vulnerability, and the request for 

authorization to exploit it; and the regulation of the dual use of vulnerabilities. 

68. Likewise, for the purpose of implementing the state use of spyware, the “dropper/payload” 

model should be adopted, which consists of the use of a (confidential) software to intrude into the 

target’s system or device (the “dropper”), and a different one (t he “payload”) to capture the 

information or digital evidence included in the judicial authorization, whose operation can be 

disclosed or divulged to the defense of the eventual defendants. 

69. In all cases, it must be ensured that the software tool is encryp ted based on the specific 

characteristics of the target system (in order to prevent it from being downloaded by mistake to 

another system or device), and that it is programmed to self -destruct once the investigative 

measure is completed. 

70. All steps and ac tions taken to introduce the spyware into the target’s equipment should be 

documented. In addition, the characteristics of the program used to carry out the monitoring and 

the changes that this program must make to the system in order to allow the intercep tion and 

avoid detection must be recorded. This, in order to be able to demonstrate that the evidence has 

not been destroyed or altered. 

71. In view of the potential impact that the use of spyware for investigative purposes may have 

on the right to privacy of citizens, it is recommended that the use of this measure be expressly 

regulated in the procedural regulations, establishing as clearly as possible the requirements for the 

use of such a computer tool and the precautions to be taken in its implementation, in accordance 

with the legal principles in force in each State. If the state use of spyware is carried out by 

analogically applying other procedural rules or by virtue of the principle of freedom of evidence, 

the adoption of certain precautions is suggeste d so that the investigation measure through the use 

of spyware affects as little as possible the right to intimacy and privacy of the persons who are the 

object of the investigation. Among them: 

• That the judicial authorization specifies: (a) the devices and data or digital content subject 

to the measure; (b) the scope of the measure; and (c) the manner in which the relevant 

information is to be accessed and collected. 

• That the use of this method be limited only to the investigation of serious crimes. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets
> 131

• That a certification process be established for the software used, providing for the 

possibility of verifying its operation to ensure impartiality and confidentiality. 

• That defense attorneys can access the documentation related to the investigative 

measures ca rried out by means of computer programs and can verify whether the programs 

used have been certified. 

• That the obligation to uninstall the programs at the end of their use be established. 

C. SEIZURE AND CONFISCATION OF VIRTUAL ASSETS 

Overview – Centralized and decentralized VAs 

72. For the purposes of seizure or confiscation of VAs, a distinction must be made between 

centralized and decentralized virtual currencies. In the first case, the measure on VAs can be 

carried out by addressing a court order to the central administrative authority that maintains 

exclusive control over the assets, ordering the freezing or seizure of the funds. 

73. When dealing with decentralized currencies (such as cryptocurrencies), the non -existence 

of a central bank or similar institution that can freeze the funds in compliance with a court order 

determines that, in many cases, the intervening state authority will have to carry out the seizure 

or confiscation by its own means, without the intervention of any intermediary. 

74. One exception is in cases where the VAs subject to seizure or confiscation are housed in a 

“custodial” wallet (where the private key that controls the movement of the VAs is in the hands of 

a VASP and not the holder). In this case, as in the case of centralize d currencies, the asset measure 

can be carried out by addressing a judicial order to the VASP, ordering the freezing or seizure of 

the assets. 

75. When the private keys controlling the VAs are in the hands of their holders, on the other 

hand, the freezing of funds is not feasible. This is because, in practice, any person holding the 

private key can dispose of the funds associated with the address of the VA corresponding to that 

key, while there may be multiple copies of each private key, stored in different p laces and in 

different formats, and to which different persons may have access. Therefore, as long as the 

cryptocurrencies are in the wallet of the suspected person, even if that person is in custody, any 

third party with the key can irrevocably transfer t he VAs. 

Securing measures 

76. In this case, the only way to safeguard the State authorities’ ability to seize VAs is to 

transfer them to a wallet controlled by them as soon as possible, so as to prevent a third party 

from removing the funds before they can pa ss into the hands of the State. To this end, Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets
> 132

it is necessary to obtain either the private key associated with the VA address corresponding to 

the assets to be seized or confiscated, or the “seed phrase” that makes it possible to reconstruct 

the wallet in w hich the VAs are housed. 

Policies or protocols 

77. It is recommended that the agencies that may have to carry out this type of measures 

establish beforehand internal policies or protocols that regulate the seizure of VAs and their 

subsequent treatment. This should include, as a minimum: 

• The identificatio n of the officials authorized to carry out seizures or transactions with VAs. 

• The details of the internal and external notifications that need to be made when a case 

involves VAs. 

• Standard procedures for collecting and preserving electronic evidence. 

• The chain of custody protocols that should govern all devices that may contain electronic 

evidence. 

Preparatory or pre -seizure measures for seizure of VAs 

78. As part of the preparation prior to the seizure or confiscation procedure, it is recommended 

that th e type of cryptocurrencies and wallets operated by the person under investigation be 

determined before proceeding. The identification of the wallet is necessary, since not all wallets 

support multiple cryptocurrencies, and the differences between the vario us types of wallets 

influence the technical methodology to be used to transfer the VAs contained therein, for the 

purposes of seizure and confiscation. Moreover, the identification of the specific class of 

cryptocurrency(ies) involved is essential, since t hese can only be transferred to an address 

corresponding to their own Blockchain. 

79. Such information can be obtained in various ways. For example, if a seller’s activity on an 

illicit online marketplace is investigated, the type of VA accepted as payment i s going to be listed 

in his profile. The data can also be obtained through OSINT techniques, Blockchain analysis, etc. 

80. It is also recommended that certain “best practices” be adopted in anticipation of a search 

that may result in VA seizure, including: 

• Being aware of when the suspected person’s devices are logged in or in use (by determining 

patterns of behavior, network monitoring, surveillance, or undercover action, as 

appropriate). Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets
> 133

• Constant monitoring of the target’s activity and the behavior of their VAs address(es). 

• Prepare for the possibility of encountering accounts that require two -factor 

authentication. 

• To the extent possible, ensure access to fingerprints or other biometric data that would 

allow access to devices protected by such means (e.g., by having the holder of such devices 

in custody or having authorization to arrest the holder during the search and compel the 

opening of the devices). 

81. Given the importance of speed in the seizure of VAs, it is important to obtain judicial 

authorization to c arry it out before proceeding with any search that may result in the discovery of 

the wallet(s) of the person under investigation. It is also important that the judicial authorization 

includes the following: 

• Permission to seize, in the course of the sear ch, all data storage devices that may be found 

in the home or offices of the person under investigation (removable hard disks, CDRs, 

DVDRs, memory sticks, pendrives, etc.). This, since they can be “hardware wallets” or 

otherwise contain important informati on in digital format, such as the “seed words” that 

allow reconstructing a VA wallet, the passwords used by the user to access a hybrid wallet, 

etc. 

• Authorization so that, in the event that during the search of a home —or the arrest of a 

suspect —it is found that the suspect’s computer or smartphone or tablet is unlocked and 

active, this circumstance can be used to analyze its contents in search of VA wallets. This 

is because the ideal opportunity to seize cryptocurrencies is when the wallet containing 

the pr ivate key(s) is open, or when the password to open it or the “seed phrase” that allows 

it to be reconstructed is found during registration. 

• Permission to isolate the persons present during the procedure in order to prevent them 

from connecting to the Internet or making contact with the outside world, until the seizure 

has been completed. This, in order to prevent that while the measure is being developed, 

any accomplice of the person under investigation transfers the funds to be obtained. 

Registration or search of domiciles 

82. In planning home searches that may result in seizure or confiscation of VA, consideration 

should also be given to the need to neutralize, as soon as possible, any possibility that the person 

under investigation destroys, alters or co nceals information useful for accessing the VA wallet 

(handwritten passwords or pins, hardware wallets, etc.) transfer its contents or give notice to a 

third party to do it for him before the authorities access it. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets
> 134

83. Pre -seizure or confiscation planning al so includes the generation of VA addresses 

controlled by the LEA or authority in charge of the proceeding in accordance with local law. For 

this purpose, it is recommended that the public and private keys be generated with a wallet 

application on a compute r not connected to the Internet, and then use a Blockchain browser to 

verify that there is no record of the public address on it. Finally, the public key (but not the private 

key) must be transferred from the initial computer to a laptop equipped with the necessary 

applications to perform a VA transfer, which is the one that is going to be taken to the procedure 

to realize the seizure. 

84. If a search of a property (whether a home, an office or even cars, boats, etc.) is carried out 

in the context of an invest igation for possible illicit use of VAs that may lead to their seizure, 

emphasis should be placed on the detection of different elements that may be relevant either as 

evidence, as information leading to evidence, or as a key to enable the seizure or confi scation of 

VAs of illicit origin. For instance: 

• Computers or other devices containing information in electronic format, such as cell 

phones, tablets, pen drives, removable hard disks, etc. 

• VA wallets, either in virtual format (such as applications within the aforementioned 

electronic equipment) or in physical format, such as hardware or paper wallets. 

• Information that allows access to the wallets or the transfer of VAs, such as passwords or 

pins to access encrypted wallets or online wallets hosted in exte rnal servers, VA addresses 

and —especially —the private keys or “seed words.” 

Wallets 

85. Virtual wallets (desktop or mobile) are generally identified by an icon on the computer 

desktop or cell phone home page. Otherwise, they can be located by using the compu ter’s search 

engine to identify the files with the word “wallet” or a “.dat” extension (although in some cases, 

the user may have saved them with another name or extension). The following image illustrates 

the icons of some of the most popular wallets: Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets

135 

86. If a paper wallet is discovered (as the one illustrated in the following image), it is possible 

to verify the existence of funds by scanning the QR code and using a mobile application to check 

it against the information available on the Blockchain of the cryptocurrency in question. The same 

app can be used to transfer the VAs to a wallet controlled by the authorities, thus completing the 

seizure of the funds. 

87. Since VA wallets are usually protected by passwords (to gain access) or by pins (to enable 

transactions), the searched location —and especially the environment around the location of the 

investigated person’s computer —should be carefully checked for handwritten notes, notebooks, 

journals, diaries, sticky notes, etc., in which the passwords or pins necessary to carry out 

transactions may have been entered. 

88. If, during the search, the investigators find the “seed words” (as shown in the following image), 

they can use them to reconstruct the wallet (including its private key) and thus tran sfer the VAs to 

a state -controlled wallet, thus completing the seizure. To this effect, 12 or 24 words are introduced 

and at the end of the last one, an exact copy of the original wallet is obtained. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets
> 136

89. Not all wallets follow the same protocols. Therefore, depending on the type of wallet in 

question, its reconstruction from the seed phrase may yield the same result as if accessing the 

original (all the VAs contained in it), or an empty wallet. There are applications that make it possible 

to determ ine what type of result the reconstruction of a given wallet by means of the seed phrase 

will produce. 

90. It is also useful to find the “Returning customer number” with which some VA mixers 

identify people who use their services more than once. Although this number does not facilitate 

the seizure of cryptocurrencies of illicit origin, it is useful as evidence of the use of mixers, as well 

as —potentially —to identify the specific mixer that processed the VAs of the person under 

investigation and allow an eventu al traceability through “Chain analysis” techniques. 

91. Due to its greater technical difficulty, it is preferable that the seizure of VAs be carried out 

by specialized and trained personnel, since, in addition, speed may be essential to ensure the 

success o f the seizure. Therefore, it is necessary that those carrying out the seizure are aware of 

the different varieties of VA wallets and the security mechanisms they have. 

92. The best way to carry out the seizure of VAs contained in a wallet controlled by the pe rson 

under investigation is to do so while the wallet is unblocked and in use. To this effect, it should be 

ensured, if possible, that the procedure aimed at obtaining control over the device containing the 

wallet is carried out in such a way as to surpris e the person under investigation when he/she is 

using it. 

93. Once access to the wallet has been obtained, it is essential to take the necessary measures 

to ensure that they are kept on and in use, in order to prevent them from being blocked again, 

hindering access to the wallet or protecting the contents by means of encryption. 

94. It is important to keep in mind that a cryptocurrency wallet may host multiple addresses 

(in some cases, even of different cryptocurrencies) containing VAs potentially subject to sei zure. 

95. Digital files containing virtual wallets (desktop or mobile) must be exported from the device 

of the person under investigation with the help of a computer forensic tool. A digital image of the 

entire wallet must be made, as well as copies or digita l images (as the case may be) of the private 

keys or seed words found in paper documents or in text or Word files. They should then be 

imported into the computer of the investigative agency that has the necessary software to carry 

out the seizure. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets
> 137

Perfect ion of the seizure 

96. The actual seizure takes place when the VAs are transferred from the address of the person 

under investigation to the one controlled by the competent authority, for which purpose the 

computer used by the agents must be connected to the I nternet and, where appropriate, also 

synchronized with the corresponding Blockchain. 

Additional recommendations for the effective seizure and confiscation of VAs 

97. In relation to the seizure and confiscation of VAs, it is recommended to adopt a number of 

best practices, including the following: 

• As far as possible, have the state address(es) converted in advance to QR format, in order 

to avoid typing errors (especi ally if the seizure is conducted with mobile wallets, where it 

is more feasible to make such errors). 

• Otherwise, it is recommended to double, or triple check the destination address 

individually before making the transfer. 

• Use the “sweep” function of VA w allets, which simply transfers the entire balance of the 

wallet being seized to the destination wallet (in this case, the one previously set up by the 

authorities carrying out the seizure). 

• For the purpose of speed, set the highest fee that is authorized, in order to ensure that 

Blockchain miners place it in the nearest block and that it is realized more quickly. 

• If state -controlled addresses are stored in paper wallets, ensure that the private keys are 

not visible, or that they are multi -signed, in order to reduce the risk of theft of seized VAs. 

• When the minutes or report on the seizure of VAs are drawn up, the private key or the 

seed phrase that enables their transfer should not be recorded in any case. 

• Once the seizure has been completed, the balance of the previously emptied VA 

address(es) should be periodically verified, since it may happen that transfers or payments 

are received after the procedure. 

98. If the wallet is blocked and the password required to access it cannot be found, the device 

containi ng it must be seized (as would be done with any other device containing relevant digital 

evidence), adopting the necessary precautions established in the protocols on the treatment of 

electronic evidence. Subsequently, and bearing in mind the need to act a s quickly as possible, the 

relevant investigative measures should be taken to try to obtain the passwords and seize the VAs 

associated with it. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets
> 138

99. If the seizure of VAs proves impossible, the information contained in the Blockchain can 

be used to establish t he value of the funds subject to confiscation and proceed to the seizure of 

assets of equivalent value. 

Post -seizure steps 

100. Once VAs have been seized, the choice is between: (a) holding them until the final 

confiscation order is issued; or (b) converting them immediately (or within a short period of time) 

into fiat currency. In order to choose one or the other option, the risk of VAs depreciation due to 

the fluctuation in the cryptocurrency price, on the one hand, and the security risks and costs 

associate d with the storage of VAs, on the other hand, must be taken into account. 

Management of VAs during the course of the process 

101. It may be desirable to establish a procedure for consultation with the previous holder of 

the seized VAs (i.e., the person under i nvestigation) in order to obtain his or her written opinion as 

to whether he or she prefers that they be kept in their original state or converted into fiat currency. 

In this way, if they are to be returned at a later date, the State is released from liabi lity for any loss 

of value. 

102. A fixed time frame for the conversion of seized VAs into fiat currency (e.g., three days) can 

also be established in advance (either through a regulation or written internal policies), so that the 

decision to convert seized VAs into fiat currency does not depend on a judgment of their economic 

convenience. 

Liquidation of the VAs 

103. Once the decision to liquidate the seized or confiscated VAs has been taken, the sale may 

be carried out directly or at public auction in an attempt to maximize the value obtained, in 

accordance with the provisions of the applicable legislation or as decided by the competent 

authority. An agreement may also be reached with a private operator specialized in the exchange 

of VAs ( i.e., a VASP) to undertake the conversion of cryptocurrencies into fiat currency. 

104. If it is decided not to liquidate certain seized VAs (e.g., private currencies such as Monero), 

because it is considered that there are no legitimate uses for them in the market, the necessa ry 

security measures should be taken to ensure effective permanent storage of the VAs in question. 

105. It is recommended that the seized VAs be stored in cold storage wallets (e.g., a hardware 

wallet, or a virtual one, but contained in a computer not connecte d to the Internet, or even in paper 

wallets). Similarly, seized VAs may be stored in multi -signature wallets, so that they cannot be 

stolen by illicitly obtaining a single private key. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets
> 139

106. It is also recommended that a list of passwords for access to each of the electronic devices 

(including computers and smart phones), encrypted external storage units and seized VA wallets 

be kept in the hands of a specifically designated official, restricting access to them as much as 

possible. Seed phrases, passwords, priva te keys, pins and VA addresses obtained can be kept in 

text files, in a designated folder for each seized VA on an external storage drive (e.g., a removable 

hard drive), if possible encrypted for security. These drives should be kept offline in a specific 

secure location until required by the competent authorities to receive or transfer the VAs. 

D. CLOSING REMARKS 

Multidisciplinary approach 

107. In order to achieve greater efficiency in the investigation of ML/TF schemes involving VAs, 

it is essential to adopt a multidisciplinary approach that combines the expertise of agents with 

experience in asset investigations with that of personnel from specialized cybercrime or 

cybersecurity units. The formation of multidisciplinary groups composed of professionals from 

both areas is strongly recommended, in line with FATF Recommendation 30. 

108. It is also important that the agencies responsible for investigating this type of illicit conduct 

act in coordination with prosecutors or judicial operators trained in the field, esp ecially with regard 

to the collection, analysis and processing of electronic evidence and the seizure and confiscation 

of VAs; as well as the use of advanced technological investigation techniques or tools, such as 

chain analysis, OSINT, digital undercover agents and the use of spyware, where their use is 

permitted by local procedural legislation. 

International cooperation 

109. The transnational nature of the Internet and the VA ecosystem makes international 

cooperation an essential element of asset investigati ons into the criminal behavior associated with 

them. 

110. It is recommended that the agencies or authorities responsible for investigating ML/TF 

schemes with VAs use all available means to connect with their counterparts abroad, including 

cooperation mechanism s between law enforcement agencies (INTERPOL, EUROPOL); contact 

points for the exchange of information related to the seizure and confiscation of illicit assets 

(RRAG, CARIN, ARIN networks, StAR and GFPN); contact points for the exchange of information 

lin ked to cybercrime ( Inter -American Cybercrime Cooperation Portal and G-7 24/7 Contact 

Network); channels for international legal cooperation such as IberRed; networks for the exchange 

of financial intelligence information gathered by FIUs (Egmont Group); as well as requests for 

mutual legal assistance. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets
> 140

111. It is also important that direct contact be established with authorities in the foreign 

counterpart who are familiar with the subject matter of the cooperation request (investigations of 

illicit activity with VAs) and —in general —with the issue of digital evidence, as well as the 

establishment of informal channels of communication with similar agencies in other countries to 

facilitate collaboration. 

112. It is strongly recommended to use the RRAG for i dentifying assets and persons abroad that 

may be relevant in the framework of an investigation into ML/TF schemes using VAs and for 

learning about criminal proceedings underway in other countries. To this end, general, social, tax, 

property, and financial data may be requested through the RRAG’s secure platform, either to 

enrich the information available to investigators in the requesting country, or to facilitate the 

preparation of requests for international legal assistance with accurate data, in order to increase 

the chances of success. 

113. This platform allows for the secure exchange of information between RRAG countries and 

the 54 jurisdictions belonging to the CARIN Network. In addition, RRAG contact points can access 

information held by other internation al organizations involved in asset confiscation, such as the 

Camden Asset Recovery Inter -Agency Network (CARIN), the Global Asset Recovery Focal Point 

Network (GFPN), and Interpol’s Stolen Asset Recovery (StAR) Initiative. 

114. Also, information collected by ARIN networks around the world, including the Asset 

Recovery Inter -Agency Network for Asia Pacific (ARIN -AP) and West and Central Asia (ARIN -

WCA), the Caribbean Asset Recovery Inter -Agency Network (ARIN -CARIB), the Asset Recovery 

Inter -Agency Network for E astern Africa (ARIN -EA), Southern Africa (ARIN -SA) and West Africa 

(ARIN -WA) can also be accessed through this channel. 

115. Information can also be exchanged through the Inter -American Cooperation Portal on 

Cyber -Crime, which is managed by the Technical Secre tariat of the Meeting of Ministers of Justice 

and Other Ministers and Attorneys General of the Americas (REMJA) of the OAS. For this purpose, 

the Department of Legal Cooperation of the Secretariat for Legal Affairs of the OAS maintains an 

updated directory of criminal prosecution and police authorities that serve as contact points for 

international cooperation on cybercrime and electronic evidence. 

116. It is recommended that states that have not yet done so join, as soon as possible, the G -7

“24/7 High Tech Cr ime Contact Network” and strengthen mechanisms for information exchange 

and cooperation with other international organizations and agencies on cybercrime, such as the 

United Nations, the Council of Europe, the European Union, the Asia -Pacific Economic 

Coop eration (APEC), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the 

Commonwealth, and INTERPOL. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the

> 141

Capacity building and enhancement 

117. Given that the investigation of the illicit use of VAs involves the analysis of complex 

technologies and, therefore, requires the development of new investigative techniques and the 

acquisition of new resources and capabilities, training programs should be implemented for the 

widest possible range of personnel, so that they acquire the minimum knowledge necess ary to 

carry out —or, at least, not to compromise —asset investigations related to the illicit use of VAs. 

118. In this context, it is necessary to provide training to: 

a. Investigators, regarding the new technologies involved in asset investigations on the illeg al 

use of VAs. 

b. Police officers in general on how to recognize and react to the existence of digital evidence 

relevant to those kinds of investigations; and 

c. Forensic investigators regarding the new technologies involved. 

119. Not all investigative personnel need to specialize in the use of VAs. However, it is 

necessary to have a number of experts (proportional to the size of the jurisdiction) who are trained 

to reconstruct a chain of transactions on the Blockchain and/or to seize or confiscate VAs. Other 

personne l should only have the minimum knowledge necessary to recognize clues about the 

possible use of cryptocurrencies if they come across them in the course of an investigation or 

when conducting a search, as well as to contact specialized law enforcement offic ers within their 

jurisdiction. 

120. In this context, it is important that a sufficient number of agents receive training in the use 

of forensic tools for traceability of VAs that are available on the market or, alternatively, those 

developed internally by each country, if it decides to do so. 

121. Similarly, the relevant authorities (be they police agencies or competent prosecutors’ 

offices) must be trained to handle the different types of VA wallets that may be used in these 

procedures, as well a s the cybersecurity issues inherent to the management of the seized assets. 

122. In view of the possibility that agents not belonging to specialized units may come across 

cryptocurrencies in compliance with search warrants, etc., it is necessary that LEA perso nnel who 

may potentially find themselves in such a situation know how to recognize at least the most 

important features of the use of VAs (QR codes, seed phrases, public or private keys, different 

cryptocurrency address formats and different types of walle ts, passwords, pins, etc.). Also, on a 

more general level, they should be able to recognize devices that may contain digital evidence. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets

142 

123. Training of personnel can be carried out through the organization of training programs, the 

development of handbooks, ex change programs, and/or participation in international conferences 

or seminars. 

124. In order to expand the scope of knowledge on VAs as much as possible among law 

enforcement personnel, it is advisable to distribute reference material (brochures, instructions) 

containing detailed pages or applications related to VAs, exchange platforms, payment processors, 

and cryptocurrency wallet service providers, images of seed phrases, QR codes, paper or hardware 

wallets, and VA ATMs, etc. 

Public -private coop eration 

125. Finally, it is also recommended that public -private cooperation with private sector actors 

specialized in these new technologies be implemented in order to ensure that the LEAs and the 

Public Prosecutor’s Office units with competence in this area a re kept up to date with new 

developments in this field. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the

# ANNEX 2: COMPARATIVE LEGISLATION ON THE USE OF ADVANCED 

# INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES (DIGITAL UNDERCOVER AGENT /

# SPYWARE) 

1. This section accompanies, for the purpose of illustration, the parameters established in 

comparative legislation with respect to the regulation of advanced investigative techniques 

(in particular, the computer or digital undercover agent and the state use of spyware). 

2. For this purpose, an article that is part of the Model Legislative Texts of the Caribbean 

Community (ITU/CARICOM/CTU Model Legislative Texts) is reproduced, since it is the 

first international multilateral instrument that expressly contempla tes the incorporation of 

the use of “remote forensic software” (i.e., spyware) as an investigative tool. 

3. Likewise, the relevant articles of the Spanish Criminal Procedure Law (LEC) are reproduced, 

in accordance with the reform introduced by Organic Law ( LO) 13/2015. In this last reform, 

on the one hand, the concept of the “undercover computer agent” was incorporated into 

Spanish procedural law in paragraph 6 of article 282 bis, which already regulated the 

“traditional” undercover agent. 

4. Moreover, the co ntents of Chapters IV to X of the LEC are reproduced, which include 

provisions on the interception of telephone and telematic communications, the recording 

of oral communications by means of electronic devices, the use of technical devices for 

tracking, lo cating, and capturing images, the recording of massive information storage 

devices, and the remote recording of computer equipment. 

5. Although these provisions only expressly refer to the use of forensic software in 

connection with the remote recording of computer equipment (Chapter IX, art. 588 septies 

a), the above mentioned chapters are transcribed in their entirety because, on the one 

hand, the regulation does not exclude the possibility of using spyware also for the 

interception of telematic communicat ions, the recording of oral communications, the 

tracking and or the capture of images; 206 and, on the other hand, it is valuable for the 

thoroughness with which the requirements to carry out this kind of measures have been 

established, in order to minimize the potential impact on the right to privacy of citizens 

resulting from the use of spyware.

CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LAW – SPAIN: PROVISIONS INCORPORATED BY ORGANIC LAW 

13/2015: 

Section 282 bis :

1. For the purposes provided for in the preceding article and in the case of investigations involving 

organized crime activities, the competent investigating judge or the Public Prosecutor’s Office, 

immediately reporting to the judge, may authorize offi cers of the Judicial Police, by means of a 

well -founded resolution and taking into account their need for the purposes of the investigation, 

to act under cover of assumed identity and to acquire and transport the objects, effects, and 

instruments of the cr ime and to defer their seizure. The assumed identity will be granted by the 

Ministry of the Interior for a period of six months, extendable for periods of the same duration, 

being legitimately authorized to act in everything related to the specific investi gation and to 

participate in the legal and social traffic under such identity. The resolution by which it is agreed 

shall state the real name of the agent and the presumed identity under which he or she will act in 

the specific case. The resolution will be confidential and must be kept outside the proceedings 

with due security. The information obtained by the undercover agent must be brought to the 

attention of the person who authorized the investigation as soon as possible. Likewise, said 

information must be provided to the process in its entirety and shall be thoroughly evaluated by 

the competent judicial body. 

2. Judicial Police officers who have acted in an investigation under a false identity in accordance 

with the provisions of paragraph 1, may mainta in that identity when testifying in the process that 

may arise from the events they may have participated in and provided that this is agreed by a 

grounded judicial decision, being also subject the provisions of Organic Law 19/1994, of 

December 23. 

No offi cer of the Judicial Police may be forced to act as an undercover agent. 

3. When the investigative actions may affect fundamental rights, the undercover agent must 

request the authorization from the competent judicial body as established by the Constitutio n and 

the Law, as well as comply with the other applicable legal provisions. 

4. For the purposes indicated in paragraph 1 of this article, organized crime shall be considered as 

the association of three or more persons to carry out, on a permanent or reit erated basis, conducts 

aimed at committing any or some of the following crimes: 

(a) Offenses involving the procurement, illicit trafficking of human organs and transplantation 

thereof, provided for in Article 156 bis of the Criminal Code.

December 12, 1995, for the repression of smugg ling. 

5. The undercover agent shall be exempt from criminal liability for those actions that are a 

necessary consequence of the development of the investigation, as long as they keep due 

proportionality with the purpose of the same and do not constitute a provocation to the crime. In 

order to be able to proceed criminally against the same for the actions carried out for the purposes 

of the investigation, the Judge competent to hear the case shall, as soon as he becomes aware of 

the actions of any undercove r agent, request a report on such circumstance from the person who 

authorized the alleged identity, in view of which he shall decide what he deems appropriate. 

6. The investigating judge may authorize officers of the Judicial Police to act under assumed 

identity in communications maintained in closed channels of communication for the purpose of 

clarifying any of the crimes referred to in paragraph 4 of this article or any of the crimes provided 

for in article 588 ter a. The undercover computer agent, with specific authorization to do so, may 

himself exchange or send illicit files due to their content and analyze the results of the algorithms 

applied for the identification of such illicit files. 

7. In the course of an investigation carried out by means of a n undercover agent, the competent 

judge may authorize the taking of images and the recording of the conversations that may take 

place during the planned meetings between the agent and the person under investigation, even if 

they take place inside a home. 

CHAPTER IV 

Common provisions on the interception of telephone and telematic communications, the 

recording of oral communications by means of electronic devices, the use of technical devices 

for tracking, locating, and capturing images, the recording of mas sive information storage devices 

and the remote recording of computer equipment. 

Article 588 bis a. Guiding principles. 

1. During the investigation of the cases, any of the investigative measures regulated in this chapter 

may be agreed upon, provided that judicial authorization is granted in full compliance Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the 

> Investigation, Identification, Seizure, and Confiscation of Virtual Assets
> 147

with the principles of specialty, suitability, exceptionality, necessity, and proportionality of the 

measure. 

2. The principle of specialty requires that a measure be related to the investi gation of a specific 

crime. Technological investigative measures aimed at preventing or discovering crimes or clearing 

suspicions without an objective basis may not be authorized. 

3. The principle of suitability shall serve to define the objective and subj ective scope and duration 

of the measure by virtue of its usefulness. 

4. In application of the principles of exceptionality and necessity, the measure may only be granted: 

(a) when other measures less burdensome to the fundamental rights of the investigate d or accused 

person and equally useful for the clarification of the event are not available for the investigation, 

or 

(b) when the discovery or verification of the event under investigation, the determination of its 

author or authors, the ascertainment of their whereabouts, or the location of the proceeds of crime 

would be seriously hindered without recourse to this measure. 

5. The investigative measures regulated in this chapter shall only be considered proportionate 

when, taking into consideration all the circumstances of the case, the sacrifice of the rights and 

interests affected resulting from their adoption is not greater than the benefit to the public interest 

and to third parties. For the weighing of the conflicting interests, the assessment of the p ublic 

interest will be based on the seriousness of the events, their social transcendence or the 

technological scope of production, the intensity of the existing evidence and the relevance of the 

result pursued with the restriction of the right. 

Article 5 88 bis b. Request for judicial authorization. 

1. The judge may order the measures regulated in this chapter ex officio or at the request of the 

Public Prosecutor’s Office or the Judicial Police. 

2. When the Public Prosecutor’s Office or the Judicial Police request a technological investigation 

measure from the investigating judge, the request must contain: 

1. The description of the event under investigation and the identity of the investigated person or 

any other person affected by the measure, provided tha t such data are known. 

2. The detailed statement of the reasons justifying the need for the measure in accordance with 

the guiding principles set forth in article 588 bis a, as well as the indications of criminality that have 

been revealed during the inves tigation prior to the request for authorization of the event in 

question. 

3. The identification data of the investigated or accused and, where appropriate, of the means of 

communication used to enable the execution of the measure. 

4. The extent of the measure with specification of its content. 

5. The investigative unit of the Judicial Police that will be in charge of the intervention. 

6. The form of execution of the measure. 

7. The duration of the requested measure. 

8. The reporting institution that wil l carry out the measure, in case it is known. Guide on Relevant Aspects and Appropriate Steps for the

Article 588 bis c. Court Decision. 

1. The investigating judge will authorize or deny the requested measure by self -motivation, after 

hearing the Public Prosecutor’s Office. This resolution will be issued withi n a maximum period of 

twenty -four hours from the filing of the request. 

2. Whenever it is necessary to resolve on the fulfillment of any of the requirements expressed in 

the previous articles, the judge may require, with interruption of the term referred t o in the 

previous paragraph, an extension or modification of the terms of the request. 

3. The judicial decision authorizing the measure shall specify at least the following: 

(a) The punishable act under investigation and its legal description, with an expression of the 

rational indications on which the measure is based. 

(b) The identity of the investigated persons and of any other person affected by the measure, if 

known. 

(c) The extent of the measure taken, specifying its scope, as well as the reasonin g regarding 

compliance with the guiding principles set forth in article 588 bis a. 

(d) The investigative unit of the Judicial Police that will be in charge of the intervention. 

(e) The duration of the measure. 

(f) The form and periodicity with which the ap plicant will inform the judge about the results of the 

measure. 

(g) The purpose of the measure. 

(h) The reporting institution who will carry out the measure, if known, with express mention of the 

duty of collaboration and secrecy, where appropriate, under penalty of incurring a crime of 

disobedience.
