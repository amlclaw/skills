## Associated Entities Requirements

### Scope of Application

This Guideline is intended for use by associated entities (AEs) that are not authorized financial institutions and their officers and staff.

### For AEs that are Authorized Financial Institutions

An AE that is an authorized financial institution should have regard to:
1. The Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (For Authorized Institutions) issued by the HKMA
2. Paragraph 4.1.6 for the definition of "customer" for securities sector

## Mandatory Requirements

The use of the word "must" or "should" in relation to an action, consideration or measure referred to in this Guideline and the Guideline for LCs and SFC-licensed VAS Providers indicates that it is a **mandatory requirement**.

### Tailored Implementation

Given the significant differences that exist in the organisational and legal structures of different AEs, there exists no single set of universally applicable implementation measures. The content is not intended to be an exhaustive list of the means of meeting the statutory and regulatory requirements.

AEs should use this Guideline as a basis to develop measures appropriate to their structure and business activities.

## Enforcement

### Legal Implications

A failure by any person to comply with any provision of this Guideline does not by itself render the person liable to any judicial or other proceedings but, in any proceedings under the AMLO or the SFO before any court, this Guideline is admissible in evidence.

### Fitness and Properness

Any failure by an AE to have regard to the provisions of the Guideline for LCs and SFC-licensed VAS Providers may reflect adversely on:
- Its fitness and properness
- The fitness and properness of the intermediary with which the AE is in a controlling entity relationship
- The fitness and properness of the SFC-licensed VAS Provider of which the AE is a wholly owned subsidiary
