# Chapter 1 – OVERVIEW 

## Introduction 

1.1 This Guideline is published under sections 7 and 

53ZTK of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-

Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (the AMLO), 

and section 399 of the Securities and Futures 

Ordinance, Cap. 571 (the SFO). 

1.2 Terms and abbreviations used in this Guideline shall 

be interpreted by reference to the definitions set out 

in the Glossary part of this Guideline. 

1.3 Where applicable, interpretation of other words or 

phrases should follow those set out in the AMLO or 

the SFO. Unless the context otherwise requires, the 

term financial institutions (FIs) refers to licensed 

corporations (LCs) and virtual asset service providers 

licensed by the Securities and Futures Commission 

(SFC) under the AMLO (SFC-licensed VAS 

Providers). 

1.4 This Guideline is issued by the SFC and sets out the 

relevant anti-money laundering and counter-financing 

of terrorism (AML/CFT) statutory and regulatory 

requirements, and the AML/CFT standards which 

LCs and SFC-licensed VAS Providers should meet in 

order to comply with the statutory requirements 

under the AMLO and the SFO. Compliance with this 

Guideline is enforced through the AMLO and the 

SFO. LCs and SFC-licensed VAS Providers which 

fail to comply with this Guideline may be subject to 

disciplinary or other actions under the AMLO and/or 

the SFO for non-compliance with the relevant 

requirements. 

1.5 This Guideline is intended for use by FIs and their 

officers and staff. This Guideline also: 

(a) provide s a general background on the subjects of July 2012 2

money laundering and terrorist financing 

(ML/TF), including a summary of the main 

provisions of the applicable AML/CFT legislation 

in Hong Kong; and 

(b) provides practical guidance to assist FIs and their 

senior management in designing and 

implementing their own policies, procedures and 

controls in the relevant operational areas, taking 

into consideration their special circumstances so 

as to meet the relevant AML/CFT statutory and 

regulatory requirements. 

1.6 In addition to the Guideline on Anti-Money 

Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (For 

Authorized Institutions) issued by the Hong Kong 

Monetary Authority (HKMA) for use by authorized 

institutions, registered institutions (RIs) are required 

to have regard to paragraph 4.1.6 of this Guideline 

for the definition of “customer” for the securities, 

futures and leveraged foreign exchange businesses 

(hereafter collectively referred to as “securities 

sector” or “securities businesses”), paragraphs 4.20 

of this Guideline for the provisions on cross-border 

correspondent relationships applicable to the 

securities sector, Chapter 12 of this Guideline for the 

provisions in relation to virtual assets, and Appendix 

B to this Guideline for illustrative indicators of 

suspicious transactions and activities in the securities 

sector. 

1.7 The relevance and usefulness of this Guideline will 

be kept under review and it may be necessary to 

issue amendments from time to time. 

1.8 For the avoidance of doubt, the use of the word 

“must” or “should” in relation to an action, 

consideration or measure referred to in this Guideline 

indicates that it is a mandatory requirement. Given 

the significant differences that exist in the 

organisational and legal structures of different FIs as 

well as the nature and scope of the business 

activities conducted by them, there exists no single July 2012 3

set of universally applicable implementation 

measures. The content of this Guideline is not 

intended to be an exhaustive list of the means of 

meeting the statutory and regulatory requirements. 

FIs therefore should use this Guideline as a basis to 

develop measures appropriate to their structure and 

business activities. 

1.9 This Guideline also provides guidance in relation to 

the operation of the provisions of Schedule 2 to the 

AMLO (Schedule 2). 

> s.7 &
> s.53ZTK(5)
> & (6)(b),
> AMLO,
> s.399(6),
> SFO

1.10 A failure by any person to comply with any provision 

of this Guideline does not by itself render the person 

liable to any judicial or other proceedings but, in any 

proceedings under the AMLO or the SFO before any 

court, this Guideline is admissible in evidence; and if 

any provision set out in this Guideline appears to the 

court to be relevant to any question arising in the 

proceedings, the provision must be taken into 

account in determining that question. In considering 

whether a person has contravened a provision of 

Schedule 2, the SFC must have regard to any 

relevant provision in this Guideline.

> s.194, SFO,
> s.53ZTK
> (6)(a),
> AMLO

1.11 In addition, a failure to comply with any of the 

requirements of this Guideline by LCs or SFC-

licensed VAS Providers and (where applicable) 

licensed representatives may reflect adversely on 

their fitness and properness and may be considered 

to be misconduct.  

> s.193 &
> s.196, SFO

1.12 Similarly, a failure to comply with any of the 

requirements of the Guideline on Anti-Money 

Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (For 

Authorized Institutions) issued by the HKMA for use 

by authorized institutions or to have regard to 

paragraphs 4.1.6 and 4.20 of, Chapter 12 of, and 

Appendix B to this Guideline by RIs may reflect 

adversely on their fitness and properness and may 

be considered to be misconduct. July 2012 4

## The nature of money laundering and terrorist financing 

> s.1,
> Sch. 1,
> AMLO

1.13 The term “money laundering” is defined in section 1 

of Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the AMLO and means an 

act intended to have the effect of making any 

property: 

(a) that is the proceeds obtained from the 

commission of an indictable offence under the 

laws of Hong Kong, or of any conduct which if it 

had occurred in Hong Kong would constitute an 

indictable offence under the laws of Hong Kong; 

or 

(b) that in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, 

represents such proceeds, 

not to appear to be or so represent such proceeds. 

1.14 There are three common stages in the laundering of 

money, and they frequently involve numerous 

transactions. An FI should be alert to any such sign 

for potential criminal activities. These stages are: 

(a) Placement - the disposal of cash proceeds 

derived from illegal activities into the financial 

system; 

(b) Layering - separating illicit proceeds from their 

source by creating complex layers of financial 

transactions designed to disguise the source of 

the money, subvert the audit trail and provide 

anonymity; and 

(c) Integration - creating the impression of apparent 

legitimacy to criminally derived wealth. In 

situations where the layering process succeeds, 

integration schemes effectively return the 

laundered proceeds back into the general 

financial system and the proceeds appear to be 

the result of, or connected to, legitimate business 

activities. 

Potential uses of the securities sector in the money laundering process 

1.15 Since the securities businesses are no longer July 2012 5

predominantly cash based, they are less conducive 

to the initial placement of criminally derived funds 

than other financial industries, such as banking. 

Where, however, the payment underlying these 

transactions is in cash, the risk of these businesses 

being used as the placement facility cannot be 

ignored, and thus due diligence must be exercised. 

1.16 The securities businesses are more likely to be used 

at the second stage of money laundering, i.e. the 

layering process. Unlike laundering via banking 

networks, these businesses provide a potential 

avenue which enables the launderer to dramatically 

alter the form of funds. Such alteration may not only 

allow conversion from cash in hand to cash on 

deposit, but also from money in whatever form to an 

entirely different asset or range of assets such as 

securities or futures contracts, and, given the liquidity 

of the markets in which these instruments are traded, 

with potentially great frequency. 

1.17 Investments that are cash equivalents, e.g. bearer 

bonds and similar investments in which ownership 

can be evidenced without reference to registration of 

identity, may be particularly attractive to the money 

launderer. 

1.18 As mentioned, transactions in the securities sector 

may prove attractive to money launderers due to the 

liquidity of the reference markets. The combination 

of the ability to readily liquidate investment portfolios 

procured with both licit and illicit proceeds, the ability 

to conceal the source of the illicit proceeds, the 

availability of a vast array of possible investment 

mediums, and the ease with which transfers can be 

effected between them, offers money launderers 

attractive ways to effectively integrate criminal 

proceeds into the general economy. 

1.19 The chart set out below illustrates the money 

laundering process relevant to the securities sector July 2012 6

in detail. 

Other examples of money laundering methods and 

characteristics of financial transactions that have 

been linked with terrorist financing can be found on 

the websites of the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit 

(JFIU) (www.jfiu.gov.hk) and the Financial Action 

Task Force (FATF) (www.fatf-gafi.org). 

> s.1,
> Sch. 1,
> AMLO

1.20 The term “terrorist financing” is defined in section 1 of 

Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the AMLO and means: 

(a) the provision or collection, by any means, directly 

or indirectly, of any property-

(i) with the intention that the property be used; 

or 

(ii) knowing that the property will be used, 

in whole or in part, to commit one or more 

terrorist acts (whether or not the property is 

actually so used); or 

(b) the making available of any property or financial 

(or related) services, by any means, directly or 

indirectly, to or for the benefit of a person 

knowing that, or being reckless as to whether, 

the person is a terrorist or terrorist associate; or July 2012 7

(c) the collection of property or solicitation of 

financial (or related) services, by any means, 

directly or indirectly, for the benefit of a person 

knowing that, or being reckless as to whether, 

the person is a terrorist or terrorist associate. 

1.21 Terrorists or terrorist organisations require financial 

support in order to achieve their aims. There is often 

a need for them to obscure or disguise links between 

them and their funding sources. It follows then that 

terrorist groups must similarly find ways to launder 

funds, regardless of whether the funds are from a 

legitimate or illegitimate source, in order to be able to 

use them without attracting the attention of the 

authorities. 

## Legislation concerned with ML, TF, financing of 

## proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (PF) and 

## financial sanctions 

1.22 The FATF is an inter-governmental body established 

in 1989. The objectives of the FATF are to set 

standards and promote effective implementation of 

legal, regulatory and operational measures for 

combating of ML, TF, PF, and other related threats to 

the integrity of the international financial system. The 

FATF has developed a series of Recommendations 

that are recognised as the international standards for 

combating of ML, TF and PF. They form the basis 

for a co-ordinated response to these threats to the 

integrity of the financial system and help ensure a 

level playing field. In order to ensure full and 

effective implementation of its standards at the global 

level, the FATF monitors compliance by conducting 

evaluations on jurisdictions and undertakes stringent 

follow-up after the evaluations, including identifying 

high risk and other monitored jurisdictions which 

could be subject to enhanced scrutiny by the FATF 

or counter-measures by the FATF members and the 

international community at large. Many major 

economies have joined the FATF which has 

developed into a global network for international July 2012 8

cooperation that facilitates exchanges between 

member jurisdictions. As a member of the FATF, 

Hong Kong is obliged to implement the AML/CFT 

requirements as promulgated by the FATF, which 

include the latest FATF Recommendations 1 and it is 

important that Hong Kong complies with the 

international AML/CFT standards in order to maintain 

its status as an international financial centre. 

1.23 The main pieces of legislation in Hong Kong that are 

concerned with ML, TF, PF and financial sanctions 

are the AMLO, the Drug Trafficking (Recovery of 

Proceeds) Ordinance (DTROP), the Organized and 

Serious Crimes Ordinance (OSCO), the United 

Nations (Anti-Terrorism Measures) Ordinance 

(UNATMO), the United Nations Sanctions Ordinance 

(UNSO) and the Weapons of Mass Destruction 

(Control of Provision of Services) Ordinance 

(WMD(CPS)O). It is very important that FIs and their 

officers and staff fully understand their respective 

responsibilities under the different legislation. 

AMLO  

> s.23,
> Sch. 2

1.24 The AMLO imposes requirements relating to 

customer due diligence (CDD) and record-keeping 

on FIs and provides relevant authorities (RAs) with 

the powers to supervise compliance with these 

requirements and other requirements under the 

AMLO. In addition, section 23 of Schedule 2

requires FIs to take all reasonable measures (a) to 

ensure that proper safeguards exist to prevent a

contravention of any requirement under Parts 2 and 

3 of Schedule 2; and (b) to mitigate ML/TF risks.  

> s.5,
> AMLO

1.25 The AMLO makes it a criminal offence if an FI (1) 

knowingly; or (2) with the intent to defraud any RA, 

contravenes a specified provision of the AMLO. The 

“specified provisions” are listed in section 5(11) of the 

AMLO. If the FI knowingly contravenes a sp ecified   

> 1The FATF Recommendations can be found on the FATF’s website (www.fatf-gafi.org). July 2012 9

provision, it is liable to a maximum term of 

imprisonment of 2 years and a fine of $1 million upon 

conviction. If the FI contravenes a specified 

provision with the intent to defraud any RA, it is liable 

to a maximum term of imprisonment of 7 years and a 

fine of $1 million upon conviction.  

> s.5,
> AMLO

1.26 The AMLO also makes it a criminal offence if a

person who is an employee of an FI or is employed 

to work for an FI or is concerned in the management 

of an FI (1) knowingly; or (2) with the intent to 

defraud the FI or any RA, causes or permits the FI to 

contravene a specified provision in the AMLO. If the 

person who is an employee of an FI or is employed 

to work for an FI or is concerned in the management 

of an FI knowingly contravenes a specified provision, 

he is liable to a maximum term of imprisonment of 2 

years and a fine of $1 million upon conviction. If that 

person does so with the intent to defraud the FI or 

any RA, he is liable to a maximum term of 

imprisonment of 7 years and a fine of $1 million upon 

conviction. 

> s.21 &
> s.53ZSP,
> AMLO

1.27 RAs may take disciplinary actions against FIs for any 

contravention of a specified provision in the AMLO. 

The disciplinary actions that can be taken include 

publicly reprimanding the FI; ordering the FI to take 

any action for the purpose of remedying the 

contravention; and ordering the FI to pay a pecuniary 

penalty not exceeding the greater of $10 million or 3 

times the amount of profit gained, or costs avoided, 

by the FI as a result of the contravention. 

DTROP 

1.28 The DTROP contains provisions for the investigation 

of assets that are suspected to be derived from drug 

trafficking activities, the freezing of assets on arrest 

and the confiscation of the proceeds from drug 

trafficking activities upon conviction. July 2012 10 

OSCO 

1.29 The OSCO, among other things: 

(a) gives officers of the Hong Kong Police Force and 

the Customs and Excise Department powers to 

investigate organised crime and triad activities; 

(b) gives the Courts jurisdiction to confiscate the 

proceeds of organised and serious crimes, to 

issue restraint orders and charging orders in 

relation to the property of a defendant of an 

offence specified in the OSCO; 

(c) creates an offence of ML in relation to the 

proceeds of indictable offences; and 

(d) enables the Courts, under appropriate 

circumstances, to receive information about an 

offender and an offence in order to determine 

whether the imposition of a greater sentence is 

appropriate where the offence amounts to an 

organised crime/triad related offence or other 

serious offences. 

UNATMO 

1.30 The UNATMO is principally directed towards 

implementing decisions contained in relevant United 

Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs) 

aimed at preventing the financing of terrorist acts and 

combating the threats posed by foreign terrorist 

fighters. Besides the mandatory elements of the 

relevant UNSCRs, the UNATMO also implements the 

more pressing elements of the FATF 

Recommendations specifically related to TF. 

> s.25,
> DTROP &
> OSCO

1.31 Under the DTROP and the OSCO, a person commits 

an offence if he deals with any property knowing or 

having reasonable grounds to believe it to represent 

any person’s proceeds of drug trafficking or of an 

indictable offence respectively. The highest penalty 

for the offence upon conviction is imprisonment for 

14 years and a fine of $5 million.  

> s.6, s.7,
> s.8, s.8A,

1.32 The UNATMO, among other things, criminalises the July 2012 11  

> s.13 & s.14,
> UNATMO

provision or collection of property and making any 

property or financial (or related) services available to 

terrorists or terrorist associates. The highest penalty 

for the offence upon conviction is imprisonment for 

14 years and a fine. The UNATMO also permits 

terrorist property to be frozen and subsequently 

forfeited. 

> s.25A,
> DTROP &
> OSCO,
> s.12 & s.14,
> UNATMO

1.33 The DTROP, the OSCO and the UNATMO also 

make it an offence if a person fails to disclose, as 

soon as it is reasonable for him to do so, his 

knowledge or suspicion of any property that directly 

or indirectly, represents a person’s proceeds of, was 

used in connection with, or is intended to be used in 

connection with, drug trafficking, an indictable 

offence or is terrorist property respectively. This 

offence carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 3 

months and a fine of $50,000 upon conviction. 

> s.25A,
> DTROP &
> OSCO,
> s.12 & s.14,
> UNATMO

1.34 “Tipping-off” is another offence under the DTROP, 

the OSCO and the UNATMO. A person commits an 

offence if, knowing or suspecting that a disclosure 

has been made, he discloses to any other person 

any matter which is likely to prejudice any 

investigation which might be conducted following that 

first-mentioned disclosure. The maximum penalty for 

the offence upon conviction is imprisonment for 3 

years and a fine. 

UNSO 

1.35 The UNSO provides for the imposition of sanctions 

against persons and against places outside the 

People’s Republic of China arising from Chapter 7 of 

the Charter of the United Nations. Most UNSCRs 

are implemented in Hong Kong under the UNSO. 

WMD(CPS)O  

> s.4,
> WMD(CPS)O

1.36 The WMD(CPS)O controls the provision of services 

that will or may assist the development, production, 

acquisition or stockpiling of weapons capable of 

causing mass destruction or that will or may assist July 2012 12 

the means of delivery of such weapons. Section 4 of 

WMD(CPS)O prohibits a person from providing any 

services where he believes or suspects, on 

reasonable grounds, that those services may be 

connected to PF. The provision of services is widely 

defined and includes the lending of money or other 

provision of financial assistance. July 2012 13 

# Chapter 2 – RISK -BASED APPROACH 

## Introduction 

2.1 Applying an AML/CFT risk-based approach (RBA) is 

recognised as an effective way to combat ML/TF. 

The RBA to AML/CFT means that countries, 

competent authorities and FIs should identify, assess 

and understand the ML/TF risks to which they are 

exposed and take AML/CFT measures that are 

commensurate with those risks in order to mitigate 

them effectively. The use of an RBA allows an FI to 

allocate its resources in the most efficient way in 

accordance with priorities so that the greatest risks 

receive the highest attention. 

Therefore, FIs should have in place a process to 

identify, assess and understand the ML/TF risks to 

which they are exposed (hereafter referred to as 

“institutional risk assessment”), so as to facilitate the 

design and implementation of adequate and 

appropriate internal AML/CFT policies, procedures 

and controls (hereafter collectively referred to as 

“AML/CFT Systems” 2 ) that are commensurate with 

the ML/TF risks identified in order to properly 

manage and mitigate them. 

FIs should also assess the ML/TF risks associated 

with a customer or proposed business relationship 

(hereafter referred to as “customer risk assessment”) 

to determine the degree, frequency or extent of CDD 

measures and ongoing monitoring conducted which 

should vary in accordance with the assessed ML/TF 

risks associated with the customer or business 

relationship 3.   

> 2Guidance on AML/CFT Systems is provided in Chapter 3.
> 3Illustrative examples of possible simplified and enhanced measures are set out in paragraphs 1
> and 2 of Appendix C respectively. July 2012 14

## Institutional risk assessment 

2.2 An institutional risk assessment enables an FI to 

understand how, and to what extent, it is vulnerable 

to ML/TF. 

2.3 An FI should take appropriate steps to identify, 

assess, and understand its ML/TF risks which should 

include: 

(a) considering all relevant risk factors before 

determining the level of overall risk and the 

appropriate level and type of mitigating measures 

to be applied (see paragraphs 2.6 to 2.8); 

(b) keeping the risk assessment up-to-date (see 

paragraph 2.9); 

(c) documenting the risk assessment (see paragraph 

2.10); 

(d) obtaining the approval of senior management of 

the risk assessment results (see paragraph 2.11); 

and 

(e) having appropriate mechanisms to provide risk 

assessment information to RAs upon request. 

2.4 In conducting the institutional risk assessment, an FI 

should consider quantitative and qualitative 

information obtained from relevant internal and 

external sources to identify, manage and mitigate the 

risks. This may include consideration of relevant risk 

assessments and guidance issued by the FATF, 

inter-governmental organisations, governments and 

authorities from time to time, including Hong Kong’s 

jurisdiction-wide ML/TF risk assessment and any 

higher risks notified to the FIs by the SFC. 

2.5 The nature and extent of institutional risk assessment 

procedures should be commensurate with the nature, 

size and complexity of the business of an FI. 

For FIs whose businesses are smaller in size or less 

complex in nature (for example, where the range of 

products and services offered by the FI are very July 2012 15 

limited or its customers have a homogeneous risk 

profile), a simpler risk assessment approach might 

suffice. Conversely, where the FI’s products and 

services are more varied and complex, or the FI’s 

customers have more diverse risk profiles, a more 

sophisticated risk assessment process will be 

required. 

Considering relevant risk factors 

2.6 An FI should holistically take into account relevant 

risk factors including country risk, customer risk, 

product/service/transaction risk, delivery/distribution 

channel risk and, where applicable, other risks that 

the FI is exposed to, depending on its specific 

circumstances. 

While there is no complete set of risk indicators, the 

list of illustrative risk indicators set out in Appendix A 

may help identify a higher or lower level of risk 

associated with the risk factors stated above that 

may be present in the business operations of an FI or 

its customer base and should be taken into account 

holistically whenever relevant in the institutional risk 

assessment. 

2.7 In determining the level of overall risk that the FI is 

exposed to, an FI should holistically consider a range 

of factors, including: 

(a) country risk, for example, the jurisdictions in 

which the FI is operating or otherwise exposed 

to, either through its own activities or the activities 

of customers, especially jurisdictions with greater 

vulnerability due to contextual and other risk 

factors such as: 

(i) the prevalence of crime, corruption, or 

financing of terrorism; 

(ii) the general level and quality of the 

jurisdiction’s law enforcement efforts related 

to AML/CFT; 

(iii) the regulatory and supervisory regime and 

controls; and July 2012 16 

(iv) transparency of beneficial ownership 4;

(b) customer risk, for example, the proportion of 

customers identified as high risk; 

(c) product/service/transaction risk, for example, 

(i) the characteristics of the products and 

services that it offers and transactions it 

executes, and the extent to which these are 

vulnerable to ML/TF abuse; 

(ii) the nature, diversity and complexity of its 

business, products and target markets; and 

(iii) whether the volume and size of transactions 

are in line with the usual activity of the FI and 

the profile of its customers; 

(d) delivery/distribution channel risk, for example, the 

distribution channels through which the FI 

distributes its products, including: 

(i) the extent to which the FI deals directly with 

the customer, the extent to which it relies on 

third parties to conduct CDD or other 

AML/CFT obligations and the extent to which 

the delivery/distribution channels are 

vulnerable to ML/TF abuse; and 

(ii) the complexity of the transaction chain (e.g. 

layers of distribution and sub-distribution); 

and 

(e) other risks, for example, the review results of 

compliance, internal and external audits, as well 

as regulatory findings. 

2.8 An FI should also identify and assess the ML/TF 

risks that may arise in relation to: 

(a) the development of new products and new 

business practices, including new delivery 

mechanisms (especially those that may lead to 

misuse of technological developments or 

facilitate anonymity in ML/TF schemes); and 

(b) the use of new or developing technologies for   

> 4For example, the availability of adequate, accurate and timely information on the beneficial
> ownership of legal persons and legal arrangements that can be obtained or accessed in a timely
> fashion by competent authorities in the country. July 2012 17

both new and pre-existing products, 

prior to the launch of the new products, new business 

practices or the use of new or developing 

technologies. 

The FI should take appropriate measures to mitigate 

and manage the risks identified. 

Keeping risk assessment up-to-date 

2.9 An FI should review the institutional risk assessment 

at least every 2 years, or more frequently upon 

trigger events with material impact on the firm’s 

business and risk exposure (e.g. a significant breach 

of the FI’s AML/CFT Systems, the acquisition of new 

customer segments or delivery channels, the launch 

of new products and services by the FI, or a

significant change of the FI’s operational processes). 

Documenting risk assessment 

2.10 An FI should maintain records and relevant 

documents of the institutional risk assessment, 

including the risk factors identified and assessed, the 

information sources taken into account, and the 

evaluation made on the adequacy and 

appropriateness of the FI’s AML/CFT Systems. 

Obtaining senior management approval 

2.11 The institutional risk assessment should be 

communicated to, reviewed and approved by the 

senior management of the FI. 

Other considerations 

2.12 A Hong Kong-incorporated FI with overseas 

branches and subsidiary undertakings that carry on 

the same business as an FI as defined in the AMLO 

should conduct a group-wide ML/TF risk 

assessment, to facilitate the FI to design and 

implement group-wide AML/CFT Systems as referred 

to in paragraph 3.13. July 2012 18 

If an FI is a part of a financial group and a group-

wide or regional ML/TF risk assessment has been 

conducted, it may make reference to or rely on those 

assessments provided that the assessments 

adequately reflect the ML/TF risks posed to the FI in 

the local context. 

## Customer risk assessment 

2.13 An FI should assess the ML/TF risks associated with 

a customer or a proposed business relationship. The 

information obtained in the initial stages of the CDD 

process should enable an FI to conduct a customer 

risk assessment, which would determine the level of 

CDD measures 5 to be applied. The measures must 

however comply with the legal requirements of the 

AMLO 6.

The general principle is that the amount and type of 

information obtained, and the extent to which this 

information is verified, should be increased where the 

risk associated with the business relationship is 

higher, or may be decreased where the associated 

risk is lower. 

2.14 Based on a holistic view of the information obtained 

in the course of performing CDD measures, an FI 

should be able to finalise the customer risk 

assessment, which determines the level and type of 

ongoing monitoring (including keeping customer 

information up-to-date and transaction monitoring), 

and supports the decision of the FI whether to enter 

into, continue or terminate the business relationship. 

While a customer risk assessment should always be

> 6FIs should have regard, in particular, to section 4 of Schedule 2 which permits FIs not to identify

performed at the inception of a business relationship 

with a customer, a comprehensive risk profile for 

some customers may only become evident through 

time or based upon information received from a

competent authority after establishing the business 

relationship. Therefore, an FI may have to 

periodically review and, where appropriate, update its 

risk assessment of a particular customer and adjust 

the extent of the CDD and ongoing monitoring to be 

applied to the customer. 

2.15 An FI should keep its policies and procedures under 

regular review and assess that its risk mitigation 

procedures and controls are working effectively. 

Conducting risk assessment 

2.16 An FI may assess the ML/TF risks of a customer by 

assigning a ML/TF risk rating to its customers. 

2.17 Similar to other parts of the AML/CFT Systems, an FI 

should adopt an RBA in the design and 

implementation of its customer risk assessment 

framework, and the framework should be designed 

taking into account the results of the institutional risk 

assessment of the FI and commensurate with the 

risk profile and complexity of its customer base. 

The customer risk assessment should holistically 

take into account relevant risk factors of a customer 

including the country risk, customer risk, 

product/service/transaction risk, and 

delivery/distribution channel risk. 

While there is no agreed upon set of indicators, the 

list of illustrative risk indicators set out in Appendix A 

may identify a higher or lower level of risk associated 

with the risk factors stated above and should be 

taken into account holistically whenever relevant in 

determining the ML/TF risk rating of a customer. July 2012 20

> s.20(1)(b)(ii),
> Sch. 2

2.18 An FI should keep records and relevant documents 

of the customer risk assessment so that it can 

demonstrate to the RAs, among others: 

(a) how it assesses its customer’s ML/TF risks; and 

(b) the extent of CDD measures and ongoing 

monitoring is appropriate based on that 

customer’s ML/TF risks. July 2012 21 

# Chapter 3 – AML/CFT SYSTEMS 

## Introduction 

> s.23(a)
> & (b),
> Sch. 2

3.1 An FI must take all reasonable measures to ensure 

that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of 

ML/TF and to prevent a contravention of any 

requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2. To 

ensure compliance with this requirement, an FI 

should implement appropriate AML/CFT Systems 

that are commensurate with the risks identified in its 

risk assessments. 

3.2 An FI should: 

(a) have AML/CFT Systems, which are approved by 

senior management, to enable the FI to manage 

and mitigate the risks that have been identified; 

(b) monitor the implementation of the AML/CFT 

Systems and make enhancements if necessary; 

and 

(c) implement enhanced AML/CFT Systems to 

manage and mitigate the risks where higher risks 

are identified 7.

3.3 An FI may implement simplified AML/CFT Systems 

to manage and mitigate the risks if lower risks are 

identified, provided that: 

(a) the FI complies with the statutory requirements 

set out in Schedule 2; 

(b) the lower ML/TF risk assessment is supported by 

an adequate analysis of risks having regard to 

the relevant risk factors and risk indicators; 

(c) the simplified AML/CFT Systems are 

commensurate with the lower ML/TF risks    

> 7Depending on the assessed ML/TF risks, RBA may be applied on a specific customer segment,
> a specific line of business, or a specific product or service offered. For example, where a line of

> Systems with respect to the specific line of business (e.g. more frequent internal audit review or
> more frequent reporting to senior management). July 2012 22

identified; and 

(d) the simplified AML/CFT Systems, which are 

approved by senior management, are subject to 

review from time to time. 

For the avoidance of doubt, an FI must not 

implement simplified AML/CFT Systems whenever 

there is any suspicion of ML/TF. 

## AML/CFT Systems 

3.4 Having regard to the nature, size and complexity of 

its businesses and the ML/TF risks arising from those 

businesses, an FI should implement adequate and 

appropriate AML/CFT Systems which should include: 

(a) compliance management arrangements; 

(b) independent audit function; 

(c) employee screening procedures; and 

(d) an ongoing employee training programme (see 

Chapter 9). 

Compliance management arrangements 

3.5 An FI should have appropriate compliance 

management arrangements that facilitate the FI to 

implement AML/CFT Systems to comply with 

relevant legal and regulatory obligations as well as to 

manage ML/TF risks effectively. Compliance 

management arrangements should, at a minimum, 

include oversight by the FI’s senior management, 

and appointment of a Compliance Officer (CO) and a 

Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO) 8.

Senior management oversight 

3.6 The senior management of an FI is responsible for 

implementing effective AML/CFT Systems that can 

adequately manage the ML/TF risks identified. In    

> 8The role and functions of an MLRO are detailed in paragraphs 3.9, 7.9, 7.13 to 7.25. Depending
> on the size of an FI, the functions of the CO and the MLRO may be performed by the same staff
> member. The Manager-In-Charge of Core Function responsible for managing the Anti-Money
> Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing function of the FI (i.e. MIC of AML/CFT) can be the
> CO provided that the requirements set out in paragraphs 3.7 and 3.8 are met. July 2012 23

particular, the senior management should: 

(a) appoint a CO at the senior management level to 

have the overall responsibility for the 

establishment and maintenance of the FI’s 

AML/CFT Systems; and 

(b) appoint a senior staff member as the MLRO to 

act as the central reference point for suspicious 

transaction reporting. 

3.7 In order that the CO and MLRO can discharge their 

responsibilities effectively, senior management 

should, as far as practicable, ensure that the CO and 

MLRO are: 

(a) appropriately qualified with sufficient AML/CFT 

knowledge; 

(b) subject to constraint of size of the FI, 

independent of all operational and business 

functions; 

(c) normally based in Hong Kong; 

(d) of a sufficient level of seniority and authority 

within the FI; 

(e) provided with regular contact with, and when 

required, direct access to senior management to 

ensure that senior management is able to satisfy 

itself that the statutory obligations are being met 

and that the business is taking sufficiently 

effective measures to protect itself against the 

risks of ML/TF; 

(f) fully conversant with the FI’s statutory and 

regulatory requirements and the ML/TF risks 

arising from the FI’s business; 

(g) capable of accessing, on a timely basis, all 

available information (both from internal sources 

such as CDD records and external sources such 

as circulars from RAs); and 

(h) equipped with sufficient resources, including staff 

and appropriate cover for the absence of the CO 

and MLRO (i.e. an alternate or deputy CO and 

MLRO who should, where practicable, have the 

same status). July 2012 24 

Compliance officer and money laundering reporting officer 

3.8 The principal function of the CO is to act as the focal 

point within an FI for the oversight of all activities 

relating to the prevention and detection of ML/TF and 

providing support and guidance to the senior 

management to ensure that ML/TF risks are 

adequately identified, understood and managed. In 

particular, the CO should assume responsibility for: 

(a) developing and/or continuously reviewing the FI’s 

AML/CFT Systems, including (where applicable) 

any group-wide AML/CFT Systems in the case of 

a Hong Kong-incorporated FI, to ensure they 

remain up-to-date, meet current statutory and 

regulatory requirements, and are effective in 

managing ML/TF risks arising from the FI’s 

business; 

(b) overseeing all aspects of the FI’s AML/CFT 

Systems which include monitoring effectiveness 

and enhancing the controls and procedures 

where necessary; 

(c) communicating key AML/CFT issues with senior 

management, including, where appropriate, 

significant compliance deficiencies; and 

(d) ensuring AML/CFT staff training is adequate, 

appropriate and effective. 

3.9 An FI should appoint an MLRO as a central 

reference point for reporting suspicious transactions 

and also as the main point of contact with the JFIU 

and law enforcement agencies. The MLRO should 

play an active role in the identification and reporting 

of suspicious transactions. Principal functions of the 

MLRO should include having oversight of: 

(a) review of internal disclosures and exception 

reports and, in light of all available relevant 

information, determination of whether or not it is 

necessary to make a report to the JFIU; 

(b) maintenance of records related to such internal 

reviews; and July 2012 25 

(c) provision of guidance on how to avoid tipping-off. 

Independent audit function 

3.10 Where practicable, an FI should establish an 

independent audit function which should have a

direct line of communication to the senior 

management of the FI. Subject to appropriate 

segregation of duties, the function should have 

sufficient expertise and resources to enable it to 

carry out an independent review of the FI’s AML/CFT 

Systems. 

3.11 The audit function should regularly review the 

AML/CFT Systems to ensure effectiveness. This 

would include evaluating, among others: 

(a) the adequacy of the FI’s AML/CFT Systems, 

ML/TF risk assessment framework and 

application of risk-based approach; 

(b) the effectiveness of the system for recognising 

and reporting suspicious transactions; 

(c) whether instances of non-compliance are 

reported to senior management on a timely 

basis; and 

(d) the level of awareness of staff having AML/CFT 

responsibilities. 

The frequency and extent of the review should be 

commensurate with the nature, size and complexity 

of the FI’s businesses and the ML/TF risks arising 

from those businesses. Where appropriate, the FI 

should seek a review from external parties. 

Employee screening 

3.12 FIs should have adequate and appropriate screening 

procedures in order to ensure high standards when 

hiring employees. 

## Group -wide AML/CFT Systems  

> s.22(1),
> Sch. 2

3.13 Subject to paragraphs 3.14 and 3.15, a Hong Kong-

incorporated FI with overseas branches or subsidiary July 2012 26 

undertakings that carry on the same business as an 

FI as defined in the AMLO should implement group-

wide AML/CFT Systems 9 to apply the requirements 

set out in this Guideline to all of its overseas 

branches and subsidiary undertakings in its financial 

group, wherever the requirements in this Guideline 

are relevant and applicable to the overseas branches 

and subsidiary undertakings concerned. 

In particular, a Hong Kong-incorporated FI should, 

through its group-wide AML/CFT Systems, ensure 

that all of its overseas branches and subsidiary 

undertakings that carry on the same business as an 

FI as defined in the AMLO, have procedures in place 

to ensure compliance with the CDD and record-

keeping requirements similar to those imposed under 

Parts 2 and 3 of Schedule 2, to the extent permitted 

by the laws and regulations of that place. 

3.14 If the AML/CFT requirements in the jurisdiction where 

the overseas branch or subsidiary undertaking of a 

Hong Kong-incorporated FI is located (host 

jurisdiction) differ from those relevant requirements 

referred to in paragraph 3.13, the FI should require 

that branch or subsidiary undertaking to apply the 

higher of the two sets of requirements, to the extent 

that the host jurisdiction’s laws and regulations 

permit.  

> s.22(2),
> Sch. 2

3.15 If the host jurisdiction’s laws and regulations do not 

permit the branch or subsidiary undertaking of a

Hong Kong-incorporated FI to apply the higher 

AML/CFT requirements, particularly the CDD and 

record-keeping requirements imposed under Parts 2 

and 3 of Schedule 2, the FI should: 

(a) inform the RA of such failure; and 

(b) take additional measures to effectively mitigate  

> 9For the avoidance of doubt, these include, but not limited to, the requirements set out in
> paragraph 3.4.

July 2012 27 

ML/TF risks faced by the branch or subsidiary 

undertaking as a result of its inability to comply 

with the requirements. 

3.16 To the extent permitted by the laws and regulations 

of the jurisdictions involved and subject to adequate 

safeguards on the protection of confidentiality and 

use of information being shared, including 

safeguards to prevent tipping-off, a Hong Kong-

incorporated FI should also implement measures, 

through its group-wide AML/CFT Systems for: 

(a) sharing information required for the purposes of 

CDD and ML/TF risk management; and 

(b) provision to the FI’s group-level compliance, 

audit and/or AML/CFT functions, of customer, 

account, and transaction information from its 

overseas branches and subsidiary undertakings 

that carry on the same business as an FI as 

defined in the AMLO, when necessary for 

AML/CFT purposes 10 .

# Chapter 4 - CUSTOMER DUE DILIGENCE 

## 4.1 What CDD measures are and when they must be 

## carried out 

General  

> s.19(3),
> Sch. 2

4.1.1 The AMLO defines what CDD measures are (see 

paragraph 4.1.4) and also prescribes the 

circumstances in which an FI must carry out CDD 

(see paragraph 4.1.9). This Chapter provides 

guidance in this regard. Wherever possible, this 

Guideline gives FIs a degree of discretion in how 

they comply with the AMLO and put in place 

procedures for this purpose. In addition, an FI 

should, in respect of each kind of customer, 

business relationship, product and transaction, 

establish and maintain effective AML/CFT Systems 

for complying with the CDD requirements set out in 

this Chapter. 

4.1.2 As stated in Chapter 2, FIs should determine the 

extent of CDD measures using an RBA, taking into 

account the higher or lower ML/TF risks identified in 

the customer risk assessment conducted by the FIs, 

so that preventive or mitigating measures are 

commensurate with the risks identified 11 . The 

measures must however comply with the legal 

requirements of the AMLO. 

FIs should also have regard to section 4 of 

Schedule 2 which permits FIs not to identify and 

take reasonable measures to verify the identities of 

the beneficial owners of specific types of customers, 

or in relation to specific types of products related to 

the transactions of the customers (see paragraphs 

4.8); and sections 8 to 15 of Schedule 2 which 

require FIs to comply with some special 

requirements in relation to specific types of 

customers, products, transactions or other high risk 

situations (see paragraphs 4.9 to 4.14).   

> 11 Illustrative examples of possible simplified and enhanced measures are set out in paragraphs 1
> and 2 of Appendix C respectively. July 2012 29

What CDD measures are 

4.1.3 CDD information is a vital tool for recognising 

whether there are grounds for knowledge or 

suspicion of ML/TF.  

> s.2(1),
> Sch. 2

4.1.4 The following are CDD measures applicable to an 

FI: 

(a) identify the customer and verify the customer’s 

identity using documents, data or information 

provided by a reliable and independent source 

(see paragraphs 4.2); 

(b) where there is a beneficial owner in relation to 

the customer, identify and take reasonable 

measures to verify the beneficial owner’s 

identity so that the FI is satisfied that it knows 

who the beneficial owner is, including, in the 

case of a legal person or trust, measures to 

enable the FI to understand the ownership and 

control structure of the legal person or trust (see 

paragraphs 4.3); 

(c) obtain information on the purpose and intended 

nature of the business relationship (if any) 

established with the FI unless the purpose and 

intended nature are obvious (see paragraphs 

4.6); and 

(d) if a person purports to act on behalf of the 

customer: 

(i) identify the person and take reasonable 

measures to verify the person’s identity using 

documents, data or information provided by a 

reliable and independent source; and 

(ii) verify the person’s authority to act on behalf 

of the customer (see paragraphs 4.4). 

4.1.5 The term “customer” is defined in the AMLO to 

include a client. The meaning of “customer” and 

“client” should be inferred from its everyday 

meaning and in the context of the industry practice. July 2012 30 

4.1.6 Unless the context otherwise requires, for the 

securities sector, the term “customer” refers to a 

person who is a client of an LC and the term “client” 

is as defined in section 1 of Part 1 of Schedule 1 to 

the SFO. For SFC-licensed VAS Providers, the 

term “customer” refers to a person to whom the 

SFC-licensed VAS Provider provides services in the 

course of providing a VA service as defined in 

section 53ZR of the AMLO. The phrase “potential 

customer” in the term “business relationship” is to 

be construed accordingly as meaning “potential 

client”. 

4.1.7 In determining what constitutes reasonable 

measures to verify the identity of a beneficial owner 

and reasonable measures to understand the 

ownership and control structure of a legal person or 

trust, the FI should consider and give due regard to 

the ML/TF risks posed by a particular customer and 

a particular business relationship. Due 

consideration should also be given to the guidance 

in relation to customer risk assessment set out in 

Chapter 2. 

4.1.8 FIs should adopt a balanced and common sense 

approach with regard to customers connected with 

jurisdictions posing a higher risk (see paragraphs 

4.13). While extra care may well be justified in such 

cases, unless an RA has, through a “notice in 

writing”, imposed a general or specific requirement 

(see paragraph 4.14.2), it is not a requirement that 

FIs should refuse to do any business with such 

customers or automatically classify them as high 

risk and subject them to the special requirements 

set out in section 15 of Schedule 2. Rather, FIs 

should weigh all the circumstances of the particular 

situation and assess whether there is a higher than 

normal risk of ML/TF. July 2012 31 

When CDD measures must be carried out 

> s.3(1) &
> (1A),
> Sch. 2

4.1.9 An FI must carry out CDD measures in relation to a 

customer: 

(a) before establishing a business relationship with 

the customer; 

(b) before carrying out for the customer an 

occasional transaction 12 :

(i) involving an amount equal to or above 

$120,000 or an equivalent amount in any 

other currency; or 

(ii) that is a wire transfer involving an amount 

equal to or above $8,000 or an equivalent 

amount in any other currency; 

whether the transaction is carried out in a single 

operation or in several operations that appear to 

the FI to be linked 13 ;

(c) when the FI suspects that the customer or the 

customer’s account is involved in ML/TF 14 ; or 

(d) when the FI doubts the veracity or adequacy of 

any information previously obtained for the 

purpose of identifying the customer or for the 

purpose of verifying the customer’s identity.  

> s.1,
> Sch. 2

4.1.10 “Business relationship” between a person and an FI 

is defined in the AMLO as a business, professional 

or commercial relationship: 

(a) that has an element of duration; or 

(b) that the FI, at the time the person first contacts it 

in the person’s capacity as a potential customer 

of the FI, expects to have an element of 

duration.  

> s.1,
> Sch. 2

4.1.11 The term “occasional transaction” is defined in the 

AMLO as a transaction between an FI and a   

> 12 Occasional transactions may include for example, wire transfers, currency exchanges, purchase
> of cashier orders or gift cheques.
> 13 FIs should also refer to the guidance provided in paragraphs 12.3 for occasional transactions in

July 2012 32 

customer who does not have a business 

relationship with the FI 15 .

4.1.12 FIs should be vigilant to the possibility that a series 

of linked occasional transactions could meet or 

exceed the CDD thresholds of $8,000 for wire 

transfers and $120,000 for other types of 

transactions. Where FIs become aware that these 

thresholds are met or exceeded, CDD measures 

must be carried out. 

4.1.13 The factors linking occasional transactions are 

inherent in the characteristics of the transactions – 

for example, where several payments are made to 

the same recipient from one or more sources over a 

short period, where a customer regularly transfers 

funds to one or more destinations. In determining 

whether the transactions are in fact linked, FIs 

should consider these factors against the timeframe 

within which the transactions are conducted. 

## 4.2 Identification and verification of the customer’s 

## identity  

> s.2(1)(a),
> Sch. 2

4.2.1 The FI must identify the customer and verify the 

customer’s identity by reference to documents, data 

or information provided by: 

(a) a governmental body; 

(b) the RA or any other RA; 

(c) an authority in a place outside Hong Kong that 

performs functions similar to those of the RA or 

any other RA; 

(d) a digital identification system that is a reliable 

and independent source that is recognised by 

the RA 16 ; or 

(e) any other reliable and independent source that

is recognised by the RA. 

Customer that is a natural person 17  

> s.2(1)(a),
> Sch. 2

4.2.2 For a customer that is a natural person, FIs should 

identify the customer by obtaining at least the 

following identification information: 

(a) full name; 

(b) date of birth; 

(c) nationality; and 

(d) unique identification number (e.g. identity card 

number or passport number) and document 

type.  

> s.2(1)(a),
> Sch. 2

4.2.3 In verifying the identity of a customer that is a

natural person, an FI should verify the name, date of 

birth, unique identification number and document 

type of the customer. The FI should do so by 

reference to documents, data or information 

provided by a reliable and independent source, 

examples of such documents, data or information 

include: 

(a) Hong Kong identity card or other national 

identity card bearing the individual’s photograph; 

(b) valid travel document (e.g. unexpired passport); 

or 

(c) other relevant documents, data or information 

provided by a reliable and independent source 

(e.g. document issued by a government body). 

The FI should retain a copy of the individual’s 

identification document or record.

information of a customer that is a natural person 18 .

Customer that is a legal person 19 

s.2(1)(a), 

Sch. 2 4.2.5 For a customer that is a legal person, an FI should 

identify the customer by obtaining at least the 

following identification information: 

(a) full name; 

(b) date of incorporation, establishment or 

registration; 

(c) place of incorporation, establishment or 

registration (including address of registered 

office); 

(d) unique identification number (e.g. incorporation 

number or business registration number) and 

document type; and 

(e) principal place of business (if different from the 

address of registered office). 

s.2(1)(a), 

Sch. 2 4.2.6 In verifying the identity of a customer that is a legal 

person, an FI should normally verify its name, legal 

form, current existence (at the time of verification), 

and powers that regulate and bind the legal person .

The FI should do so by reference to documents, 

data or information provided by a reliable and 

independent source, examples of such documents, 

data or information include 20 :

(a) certificate of incorporation; 

(b) record of companies registry ; 

> 18

For the avoidance of doubt, an FI may, under certain circumstances, further require proof of 

residential address from a customer for other purposes (e.g. group requirements, paragraph 5.4 

of the current Code of Conduct for Persons Licensed by or Registered with the Securities and 

Futures Commission (a.k.a. Client Identity Rule), and other local or overseas legal and 

regulatory requirements). In such circumstances, the FI should communicate clearly to the 

customers the reasons why it requires proof of residential address.

Legal person refers to any entities other than natural person that can establish a permanent 

customer relationship with an FI or otherwise own property. This can include companies, bodies 

corporate, foundations, anstalt, partnerships, associations or other relevantly similar entities.  

> 20

In some instances, an FI may need to obtain more than one document to meet this requirement. 

For example, a certificate of incorporation can only verify the name and legal form of the legal 

person in most circumstances but cannot act as a proof of current existence. July 2012 35 

(c) certificate of incumbency; 

(d) certificate of good standing; 

(e) record of registration; 

(f) partnership agreement or deed; 

(g) constitutive document; or 

(h) other relevant documents, data or information 

provided by a reliable and independent source 

(e.g. document issued by a government body). 

Illustrative examples of possible measures to verify 

the name, legal form and current existence of a 

legal person are set out in paragraph 3 of Appendix 

C. 

4.2.7 For a customer that is a partnership or an 

unincorporated body, confirmation of the customer’s 

membership of a relevant professional or trade 

association is likely to be sufficient to provide 

reliable and independent evidence of the identity of 

the customer as required in paragraph 4.2.6 

provided that: 

(a) the customer is a well-known, reputable 

organisation; 

(b) the customer has a long history in its industry; 

and 

(c) there is substantial public information about the 

customer, its partners and controllers. 

4.2.8 In the case of associations, clubs, societies, 

charities, religious bodies, institutes, mutual and 

friendly societies, co-operative and provident 

societies, an FI should satisfy itself as to the 

legitimate purpose of the organisation, e.g. by 

requesting sight of the constitutive document. July 2012 36

4.2.9 In respect of trusts, an FI should identify and verify 

the trust as a customer in accordance with the 

requirements set out in paragraphs 4.2.10 and 

4.2.11. The FI should also regard the trustee 23 as 

its customer if the trustee enters into a business 

relationship or carries out occasional transactions 

on behalf of the trust, which is generally the case if 

the trust does not possess a separate legal 

personality. In such a case, an FI should identify 

and verify the identity of the trustee in line with the 

identification and verification requirements for a

customer that is a natural person or, where 

applicable, a legal person.  

> s.2(1)(a),
> Sch. 2

4.2.10 For a customer that is a trust or other similar legal 

arrangement, FIs should identify the customer by 

obtaining at least the following identification 

information: 

(a) the name of the trust or legal arrangement; 

(b) date of establishment or settlement; 

(c) the jurisdiction whose laws govern the trust or 

legal arrangement; 

(d) unique identification number (if any) granted by 

any applicable official bodies and document 

type (e.g. tax identification number or registered 

charity or non-profit organisation number); and 

(e) address of registered office (if applicable).

July 2012 37  

> s.2(1)(a),
> Sch. 2

4.2.11 In verifying the identity of a customer that is a trust 

or other similar legal arrangement, an FI should 

normally verify its name, legal form, current 

existence (at the time of verification) and powers 

that regulate and bind the trust or other similar legal 

arrangement. The FI should do so by reference to 

documents, data or information provided by a

reliable and independent source, examples of such 

documents, data or information include: 

(a) trust deed or similar instrument 24 ;

(b) record of an appropriate register 25 in the 

relevant country of establishment; 

(c) written confirmation from a trustee acting in a 

professional capacity 26 ;

(d) written confirmation from a lawyer who has 

reviewed the relevant instrument; or 

(e) written confirmation from a trust company which 

is within the same financial group as the FI, if 

the trust concerned is managed by that trust 

company. 

Connected parties 

4.2.12 Where a customer is a legal person, a trust or other 

similar legal arrangement, an FI should identify the 

connected parties 27 of the customer by obtaining 

their names.

person, a trust or other similar legal arrangement:

senior management position or having executive 

authority in the customer. 

Other considerations 

4.2.14 An FI may adopt an RBA in determining the 

documents, data or information to be obtained for 

verifying the identity of a customer that is a legal 

person, trust or other similar legal arrangement. 

Illustrative examples of relevant simplified and 

enhanced measures are set out in paragraph 4 of 

Appendix C. 

## 4.3 Identification and verification of a beneficial owner 

> s.1 &
> s.2(1)(b),
> Sch. 2

4.3.1 Beneficial owner refers to the natural person(s) who 

ultimately owns or controls the customer or on 

whose behalf a transaction or activity is being 

conducted. An FI must identify any beneficial owner 

in relation to a customer, and take reasonable 

measures to verify the beneficial owner’s identity so 

that the FI is satisfied that it knows who the 

beneficial owner is. 

4.3.2 While an FI usually can identify who the beneficial 

owner of a customer is in the course of 

understanding the ownership and control structure 

of the customer, the FI may obtain an undertaking or 

declaration 28 from the customer on the identity of, 

and the information relating to, its beneficial owner. 

When identifying a beneficial owner, the FI should   

> 28 For example, an FI may obtain from a corporate customer its register of beneficial owners (i.e.
> the significant controllers register maintained in accordance with the Companies Ordinance,
> Cap. 622). July 2012 39

endeavour to obtain the same identification 

information as at paragraph 4.2.2 as far as possible. 

4.3.3 The verification requirements under the AMLO are 

different for a customer and a beneficial owner. An 

FI may adopt an RBA to determine the extent of 

reasonable measures in relation to the verification of 

the identity of a beneficial owner of a customer, 

having regard to paragraph 4.1.7. The FI may 

consider whether it is appropriate to, for example, (i) 

make use of records of a beneficial owner available 

in the public domain 29 ; (ii) request its customers to 

provide documents or information in relation to the 

identity of a beneficial owner that is obtained from a 

reliable and independent source; or (iii) where an 

undertaking or declaration is obtained from the 

customer (see paragraph 4.3.2), corroborate the 

customer’s undertaking or declaration with publicly 

available information. 

4.3.4 If the ownership structure of a customer involves 

different types of legal persons or legal 

arrangements, in determining who the beneficial 

owner is, an FI should pay attention to who has 

ultimate ownership or control over the customer, or 

who constitutes the controlling mind and 

management of the customer. 

Beneficial owner in relation to a natural person 

4.3.5 In respect of a customer that is a natural person, 

the customer is the beneficial owner, unless the 

characteristics of the transactions or other 

circumstances indicate otherwise. Therefore, there 

is no requirement on FIs to make proactive 

searches for beneficial owners of the customer in 

such a case, but they should make appropriate 

enquiries where there are indications that the 

customer is not acting on his own behalf.

4.3.6 The AMLO defines beneficial owner in relation to a 

corporation as: 

(i) an individual who 

(a) owns or controls, directly or indirectly, 

including through a trust or bearer share 

holding, more than 25% of the issued share 

capital of the corporation; 

(b) is, directly or indirectly, entitled to exercise 

or control the exercise of more than 25% of 

the voting rights at general meetings of the 

corporation; or 

(c) exercises ultimate control over the 

management of the corporation; or 

(ii) if the corporation is acting on behalf of another 

person, means the other person.

4.3.7 The AMLO defines beneficial owner, in relation to a 

partnership as: 

(i) an individual who 

(a) is entitled to or controls, directly or indirectly, 

more than a 25% share of the capital or 

profits of the partnership; 

(b) is, directly or indirectly, entitled to exercise 

or control the exercise of more than 25% of 

the voting rights in the partnership; or 

(c) exercises ultimate control over the 

management of the partnership; or 

(ii) if the partnership is acting on behalf of another 

person, means the other person.  

> s.1,
> Sch. 2

4.3.8 In relation to an unincorporated body other than a 

partnership, beneficial owner: 

(i) means an individual who ultimately owns or 

controls the unincorporated body; or 

(ii) if the unincorporated body is acting on behalf of 

another person, means the other person. July 2012 41  

> s.2(1)(b),
> Sch. 2

4.3.9 For a customer that is a legal person, an FI should 

identify any natural person who ultimately has a 

controlling ownership interest (i.e. more than 25%) 

in the legal person and any natural person 

exercising control of the legal person or its 

management, and take reasonable measures to 

verify their identities. If there is no such natural 

person (i.e. no natural person falls within the 

definition of beneficial owners set out in paragraphs 

4.3.6 to 4.3.8), the FI should identify the relevant 

natural persons who hold the position of senior 

managing official 30 in the legal person, and take 

reasonable measures to verify their identities. 

Beneficial owner in relation to a trust or other similar legal arrangement  

> s.1,
> Sch. 2

4.3.10 The AMLO defines the beneficial owner, in relation 

to a trust as: 

(i) a beneficiary or a class of beneficiaries of the 

trust entitled to a vested interest in the trust 

property, whether the interest is in possession 

or in remainder or reversion and whether it is 

defeasible or not; 

(ii) the settlor of the trust; 

(iii) the trustee of the trust; 

(iv) a protector or enforcer of the trust; or 

(v) an individual who has ultimate control over the 

trust.  

> s.2(1)(b),
> Sch. 2

4.3.11 For a customer that is a trust, an FI should identify 

the settlor, the trustee, the protector (if any), the 

enforcer (if any), the beneficiaries or class of 

beneficiaries, and any other natural person 

exercising ultimate control over the trust (including  

> 30 Examples of positions of senior managing official include chief executive officer, chief financial

through a chain of control or ownership), and take 

reasonable measures 31 to verify their identities. For 

a customer that is an other similar legal 

arrangement, an FI should identify any natural 

person in equivalent or similar positions to beneficial 

owner of a trust as stated above and take 

reasonable measures to verify the identity of such 

person. 

4.3.12 For a beneficiary of a trust designated by 

characteristics or by class 32 , an FI should obtain 

sufficient information 33 concerning the beneficiary to 

satisfy the FI that it will be able to establish the 

identity of the beneficiary at the time of payout or 

when the beneficiary intends to exercise vested 

rights. 

Ownership and control structure 

s.2(1)(b), 

Sch. 2 4.3.13 Where a customer is not a natural person, an FI 

should understand its ownership and control 

structure, including identification of any intermediate 

layers (e.g. by reviewing an ownership chart of the 

customer) 34 . The objective is to follow the chain of 

ownerships to the beneficial owners of the 

customer. 

Similar to a corporation, a trust or other similar legal  

> 31

An FI may adopt an RBA to determine the extent of reasonable measures in relation to the 

verification of the identities of the beneficiaries or class of beneficiaries of a customer that is a 

trust, which should be commensurate with the ML/TF risks associated with the customer or 

business relationship (see paragraph 4.3.3). For example, where the business relationship with 

a customer that is a trust is assessed to present a low ML/TF risk, it may be reasonable for the 

FI to verify the identities of the beneficiaries with reference to the information provided by the 

trustee that was also regarded as the customer by the FI and whose identity has been verified. 

Such information includes the identification information of the beneficiaries, and declaration that 

they are known to the trustee.  

> 32

For example, a trust may have no defined existing beneficiaries when it is set up but only a 

class of beneficiaries and objects of a power until some person becomes entitled as beneficiary 

to income or capital on the expiry of a defined period, or following exercise of trustee discretion 

in the case of a discretionary trust.  

> 33

For example, an FI may ascertain and name the scope of the class of beneficiaries (e.g. 

children of a named individual).  

> 34

Examples of information which may be collected to identify the intermediate layers of the 

corporate structure of a legal person with multiple layers in its ownership structure are set out in 

paragraph 5 of Appendix C. July 2012 43 

arrangement can also be part of an intermediate 

layer in an ownership structure, and should be dealt 

with in similar manner to a corporate being part of 

an intermediate layer. 

4.3.14 Where a customer has a complex ownership or 

control structure, an FI should obtain sufficient 

information for the FI to satisfy itself that there is a 

legitimate reason behind the particular structure 

employed. 

## 4.4 Identification and verification of a person 

## purporting to act on behalf of the customer 

4.4.1 A person may be appointed to act on behalf of a 

customer to establish business relationships, or may 

be authorised to give instructions to an FI to conduct 

various activities through the account or the 

business relationship established. Whether the 

person is considered to be a person purporting to 

act on behalf of the customer (PPTA) should be 

determined based on the ML/TF risks associated 

with that person’s roles and the activities which the 

person is authorised to conduct 35 , as well as the 

ML/TF risks associated with the business 

relationship 36 .

FIs should implement clear policies for determining 

who is considered to be a PPTA.  

> s.2(1)(d),
> Sch. 2

4.4.2 If a person purports to act on behalf of the customer, 

FIs must: 

(i) identify the person and take reasonable 

measures to verify the person’s identity by    

> 35 For example, those who carry out transactions on behalf of the customer may be considered as

reference to documents, data or information 

provided by a reliable and independent source: 

(A) a governmental body; 

(B) the RA or any other RA; 

(C) an authority in a place outside Hong Kong 

that performs functions similar to those of 

the RA or any other RA; or 

(D) any other reliable and independent source 

that is recognised by the RA; and 

(ii) verify the person’s authority to act on behalf of 

the customer. 

4.4.3 FI should identify a PPTA in line with the 

identification requirements for a customer that is a 

natural person or, where applicable, a legal person. 

In taking reasonable measures 37 to verify the 

identity of the PPTA, FI should, as far as possible, 

follow the verification requirements for a customer 

that is a natural person or, where applicable, a legal 

person.  

> s.2(1)(d)(ii),
> Sch. 2

4.4.4 FIs should verify the authority of each PPTA by 

appropriate documentary evidence (e.g. board 

resolution or similar written authorisation). 

## 4.5 Reliability of documents, data or information 

4.5.1 In verifying the identity of a customer, an FI needs 

not establish accuracy of every piece of 

identification information collected in paragraphs 

4.2.2, 4.2.5 and 4.2.10. 

4.5.2 An FI should ensure that documents, data or 

information obtained for the purpose of verifying the 

identity of a customer as required in paragraphs    

> 37 An FI may adopt an RBA to determine the extent of reasonable measures in relation to the
> verification of the identity of the PPTA, which should be commensurate with the ML/TF risks
> associated with the business relationship. For example, where a business relationship with a
> legal person customer with many PPTAs is assessed to present low ML/TF risk, an FI could
> verify the identities of the PPTAs with reference to a list of PPTAs, whose identities and
> authority to act have been confirmed by a department or person within that legal person
> customer which is independent to the persons whose identities are being verified (for example,
> compliance, audit or human resources). July 2012 45

4.2.3, 4.2.6 and 4.2.11 is current at the time they 

are provided to or obtained by the FI. 

4.5.3 When using documents for verification, an FI should 

be aware that some types of documents are more 

easily forged than others, or can be reported as lost 

or stolen 38 . Therefore, the FI should consider 

applying anti-fraud procedures that are 

commensurate with the risk profile of the person 

being verified. 

4.5.4 If a natural person customer or a person 

representing a legal person, a trust or other similar 

legal arrangement to establish a business 

relationship with an FI is physically present during 

the CDD process, the FI should generally have sight 

of original identification document by its staff and 

retain a copy of the document. However, there are 

a number of occasions where an original 

identification document cannot be produced by the 

customers (e.g. the original document is in 

electronic form). In such an occasion, the FI should 

take appropriate measures to ensure the reliability 

of identification documents obtained. 

4.5.5 Where the documents, data or information being 

used for the purposes of identification are in a

foreign language, appropriate steps should be taken 

by the FI to be reasonably satisfied that the 

documents in fact provide evidence of the 

customer’s identity 39 .

## 4.6 Purpose and intended nature of business 

## relationshi p 

> s.2(1)(c),
> Sch. 2

4.6.1 An FI must understand the purpose and intended 

nature of the business relationship. In some    

> 38 Please refer to paragraph 6 of Appendix C for illustrative examples of procedures to establish
> whether the identification documents offered by customers are genuine, or have been reported
> as lost or stolen.
> 39 For example, ensuring that staff assessing such documents are proficient in the language or
> obtaining a translation from a suitably qualified person. July 2012 46

instances, this will be self-evident, but in many 

cases, the FI may have to obtain information in this 

regard. 

4.6.2 Unless the purpose and intended nature of the 

business relationship are obvious, FIs should obtain 

satisfactory information from all new customers as 

to the intended purpose and reason for opening the 

account or establishing the business relationship, 

and record the information on the account opening 

documentation. The information obtained by the FIs 

should be commensurate with the risk profile of the 

customers and the nature of the business 

relationships. Information that might be relevant 

may include: 

(a) nature and details of the customer’s 

business/occupation/employment; 

(b) the anticipated level and nature of the activity 

that is to be undertaken through the business 

relationship (e.g. what the typical transactions 

are likely to be); 

(c) location of customer; 

(d) the expected source and origin of the funds to 

be used in the business relationship; and 

(e) initial and ongoing source(s) of wealth or 

income. 

## 4.7 Delayed identity verification during the 

## establishment of a business relationship  

> s.3(2) & (3),
> Sch. 2

4.7.1 An FI should verify the identity of a customer and 

any beneficial owner of the customer before or 

during the course of establishing a business 

relationship or conducting transactions for 

occasional customers. However, FIs may, 

exceptionally, verify the identity of a customer and 

any beneficial owner of the customer after 

establishing the business relationship, provided that: 

(a) any risk of ML/TF arising from the delayed 

verification of the customer’s or beneficial July 2012 47 

owner’s identity can be effectively managed 40 ;

(b) it is necessary not to interrupt the normal 

conduct of business with the customer; and 

(c) verification is completed as soon as reasonably 

practicable. 

4.7.2 An example of a situation in the securities industry 

where it may be necessary not to interrupt the 

normal conduct of business is when companies and 

intermediaries may be required to perform 

transactions very rapidly, according to the market 

conditions at the time the customer is contacting 

them, and the performance of the transaction may 

be required before verification of identity is 

completed. 

4.7.3 If an FI allows verification of the identity of a

customer and any beneficial owner of the customer 

after establishing the business relationship, it should 

adopt appropriate risk management policies and 

procedures concerning the conditions under which 

the customer may utilise the business relationship 

prior to verification. These policies and procedures 

should include: 

(a) establishing a reasonable timeframe for the 

completion of the identity verification measures 

and the follow-up actions if exceeding the 

timeframe (e.g. to suspend or terminate the 

business relationship); 

(b) placing appropriate limits on the number, types, 

and/or amount of transactions that can be 

performed; 

(c) monitoring of large and complex transactions 

being carried out outside the expected norms for 

that type of relationship; 

(d) keeping senior management periodically 

informed of any pending completion cases; and   

> 40 For FIs that are SFC-licensed VAS Providers, it would be highly unlikely that the ML/TF risks
> arising from the delayed verification of the customer’s or beneficial owner’s identity can be
> effectively managed. July 2012 48

(e) ensuring that funds are not paid out to any third 

party. Exceptions may be made to allow 

payments to third parties subject to the following 

conditions: 

(i) there is no suspicion of ML/TF; 

(ii) the risk of ML/TF is assessed to be low; 

(iii) the transaction is approved by senior 

management, who should take account of 

the nature of the business of the customer 

before approving the transaction; and 

(iv) the names of recipients do not match with 

watch lists such as those for terrorist 

suspects and PEPs. 

4.7.4 Verification of identity should be completed by an FI 

within a reasonable timeframe, which generally 

refers to the following: 

(a) the FI completing such verification no later than 

30 working days after the establishment of 

business relationship; 

(b) the FI suspending business relationship with the 

customer and refraining from carrying out further 

transactions (except to return funds to their 

sources, to the extent that this is possible) if 

such verification remains uncompleted 30 

working days after the establishment of 

business relationship; and 

(c) the FI terminating business relationship with the 

customer if such verification remains 

uncompleted 120 working days after the 

establishment of business relationship.

4.7.5 If verification cannot be completed within the 

reasonable timeframe set in the FI’s risk 

management policies and procedures, the FI should 

terminate the business relationship as soon as 

reasonably practicable and refrain from carrying out 

further transactions (except to return funds or other 

assets in their original forms as far as possible). 

The FI should also assess whether this failure July 2012 49 

provides grounds for knowledge or suspicion of 

ML/TF and consider making a suspicious 

transaction report (STR) to the JFIU, particularly if 

the customer requests that funds or other assets be 

transferred to a third party or be “transformed” (e.g. 

from cash into a cashier order) without a justifiable 

reason. 

## 4.8 Simplified customer due diligence (SDD) 

General  

> s.4,
> Sch. 2

4.8.1 Section 4 of Schedule 2 permits FIs not to identify 

and take reasonable measures to verify the 

identities of the beneficial owners 41 of specific types 

of customers, or in relation to specific types of 

products related to the transactions of the 

customers (referred to as “simplified customer due 

diligence” under section 4 of Schedule 2; and as 

“SDD” hereafter). However, other aspects of CDD 

must be undertaken and it is still necessary to 

conduct ongoing monitoring of the business 

relationship. The use of SDD must be supported by 

robust assessment to ensure the conditions or 

circumstances of specific types of customers or 

products specified in section 4 of Schedule 2 are 

met.

4.8.2 Nonetheless, SDD must not be or continue to be 

applied when the FI suspects that the customer, the 

customer’s account or the transaction is involved in 

ML/TF, or when the FI doubts the veracity or 

adequacy of any information previously obtained for 

the purpose of identifying the customer or verifying 

the customer’s identity, notwithstanding when the

(i) an FI as defined in the AMLO; 

(ii) an institution incorporated or established in 

Hong Kong, or in an equivalent jurisdiction 

that-

i. has measures in place to ensure 

compliance with requirements similar to 

those imposed under Schedule 2; and 

ii. is supervised for compliance with those 

requirements; 

(e) the Government or any public body in Hong 

Kong; or 

(f) the government of an equivalent jurisdiction or a 

body in an equivalent jurisdiction that performs 

functions similar to those of a public body.

4.8.4 If a customer not falling within section 4(3) of 

Schedule 2 has in its ownership chain an entity that 

falls within that section, the FI is not required to 

identify or verify the beneficial owners of that entity 

in that chain when establishing a business 

relationship with or carrying out an occasional 

transaction for the customer. However, FIs should July 2012 51 

still identify and take reasonable measures to verify 

the identities of beneficial owners in the ownership 

chain that are not connected with that entity.

4.8.5 For avoidance of doubt, the FI must still: 

(a) identify the customer and verify 42 the customer’s 

identity; 

(b) if a business relationship is to be established 

and its purpose and intended nature are not 

obvious, obtain information on the purpose and 

intended nature of the business relationship with 

the FI; and 

(c) if a person purports to act on behalf of the 

customer, 

(i) identify the person and take reasonable 

measures to verify the person’s identity; and 

(ii) verify the person’s authority to act on behalf 

of the customer, 

in accordance with the relevant requirements 

stipulated in this Guideline.

4.8.6 FIs may apply SDD to a customer that is an FI as 

defined in the AMLO, or an institution that carries on 

a business similar to that carried on by an FI and 

meets the criteria set out in section 4(3)(b) of 

Schedule 2. If the customer does not meet the 

criteria, the FI must carry out all the CDD measures 

set out in section 2 of Schedule 2. 

FI may apply SDD to a customer that is an FI as 

defined in the AMLO that opens an account: 

(a) in the name of a nominee company for holding 

fund units on behalf of the second-mentioned FI 

or its underlying customers; or 

(b) in the name of an investment vehicle in the

capacity of a service provider (such as manager 

or custodian) to the investment vehicle and the 

underlying investors have no control over the 

management of the investment vehicle’s assets; 

provided that the second-mentioned FI: 

(i) has conducted CDD: 

(A) in the case where the nominee company 

holds fund units on behalf of the second-

mentioned FI or the second-mentioned FI’s 

underlying customers, on its underlying 

customers; or 

(B) in the case where the second-mentioned FI 

acts in the capacity of a service provider 

(such as manager or custodian) to the 

investment vehicle, on the investment 

vehicle pursuant to the provisions of the 

AMLO; and 

(ii) is authorised to operate the account as 

evidenced by contractual document or 

agreement. 

4.8.7 For ascertaining whether the institution meets the 

criteria set out in section 4(3)(a) & (b) of Schedule 2, 

it will generally be sufficient for an FI to verify that 

the institution is on the list of licensed (and 

supervised) FIs in the jurisdiction concerned. 

Listed company  

> s.4(3)(c),
> Sch. 2

4.8.8 An FI may apply SDD to a customer that is a

company listed on a stock exchange. For this 

purpose, the FI should assess whether there are 

any disclosure requirements (either by stock 

exchange rules, or through law or enforceable 

means) which ensure the adequate transparency of 

the beneficial ownership of companies listed on that 

stock exchange. In such a case, it will be generally 

sufficient for an FI to obtain proof of the customer’s 

listed status on that stock exchange. July 2012 53 

Investment vehicle  

> s.4(3)(d),
> Sch. 2

4.8.9 FIs may apply SDD to a customer that is an 

investment vehicle if the FI is able to ascertain that 

the person responsible for carrying out measures 

that are similar to the CDD measures in relation to 

all the investors of the investment vehicle falls within 

any of the categories of institutions set out in section 

4(3)(d) of Schedule 2. 

4.8.10 An investment vehicle may be in the form of a legal 

person or trust, and may be a collective investment 

scheme or other investment entity. 

4.8.11 An investment vehicle whether or not responsible for 

carrying out CDD measures on the underlying 

investors under governing law of the jurisdiction in 

which the investment vehicle is established may, 

where permitted by law, appoint another institution 

(“appointed institution”), such as a manager, a

trustee, an administrator, a transfer agent, a

registrar or a custodian, to perform the CDD. Where 

the person responsible for carrying out the CDD 

measures (the investment vehicle 43 or the appointed 

institution) falls within any of the categories of 

institution set out in section 4(3)(d) of Schedule 2, 

an FI may apply SDD to that investment vehicle 

provided that it is satisfied that the investment 

vehicle has ensured that there are reliable systems 

and controls in place to conduct the CDD (including 

identification and verification of the identity) on the 

underlying investors in accordance with the 

requirements similar to those set out in the 

Schedule 2.

institution set out in section 4(3)(d) of Schedule 2, 

the FI must identify and take reasonable measures 

to verify the identity of any investor of the 

investment vehicle in accordance with the 

requirements for identification and verification of a 

beneficial owner of a specific type of customer (see 

paragraphs 4.3). The FI may consider whether it is 

appropriate to rely on a written representation from 

the investment vehicle or appointed institution (as 

the case may be) responsible for carrying out the 

CDD stating, to its actual knowledge, the identities 

of such investors or (where applicable) there is no 

such investor in the investment vehicle. This will 

depend on risk factors such as whether the 

investment vehicle is being operated for a small, 

specific group of persons. Where the FI accepts 

such a representation, this should be documented, 

retained, and subject to periodic review. 

Government and public body 

> s.4(3)(e)
> & (f),
> Sch. 2

4.8.13 FIs may apply SDD to a customer that is the Hong 

Kong Government, any public bodies in Hong Kong, 

the government of an equivalent jurisdiction or a 

body in an equivalent jurisdiction that performs 

functions similar to those of a public body.  

> s.1,
> Sch. 2

4.8.14 Public body includes: 

(a) any executive, legislative, municipal or urban 

council; 

(b) any Government department or undertaking; 

(c) any local or public authority or undertaking; 

(d) any board, commission, committee or other 

body, whether paid or unpaid, appointed by the 

Chief Executive or the Government; and 

(e) any board, commission, committee or other 

body that has power to act in a public capacity 

under or for the purposes of any enactment. 

SDD in relation to specific products  

> s.4(4) & (5),
> Sch. 2

4.8.15 FIs may apply SDD in relation to a customer if the FI 

has reasonable grounds to believe that the July 2012 55 

transaction conducted by the customer relates to 

any one of the following products: 

(a) a provident, pension, retirement or 

superannuation scheme (however described) 

that provides retirement benefits to employees, 

where contributions to the scheme are made by 

way of deduction from income from employment 

and the scheme rules do not permit the 

assignment of a member’s interest under the 

scheme; 

(b) an insurance policy for the purposes of a

provident, pension, retirement or 

superannuation scheme (however described) 

that does not contain a surrender clause and 

cannot be used as a collateral; or 

(c) a life insurance policy in respect of which: 

(i) an annual premium of no more than $8,000 

or an equivalent amount in any other 

currency is payable; or 

(ii) a single premium of no more than $20,000 

or an equivalent amount in any other 

currency is payable. 

4.8.16 For the purposes of item (a) of paragraph 4.8.15, 

FIs may generally treat the employer as the 

customer and apply SDD on the employer (i.e. 

choosing not to identify and take reasonable 

measures to verify the employees of the scheme). 

Where FIs have separate business relationships 

with the employees, it should apply CDD measures 

in accordance with relevant requirements set out in 

this Chapter. 

Solicitor’s client accounts  

> s.4(6),
> Sch. 2

4.8.17 If a customer of an FI is a solicitor or a firm of 

solicitors, the FI may apply SDD to the client 

account opened by the customer, provided that the 

following criteria are satisfied: 

(a) the client account is kept in the name of the 

customer; July 2012 56 

(b) moneys or securities of the customer’s clients in 

the client account are mingled; and 

(c) the client account is managed by the customer 

as those clients’ agent. 

4.8.18 When opening a client account for a solicitor or a 

firm of solicitors, FIs should establish the proposed 

use of the account, i.e. whether to hold co-mingled 

client funds or the funds of a specific client. 

4.8.19 If a client account is opened on behalf of a single 

client or there are sub-accounts for each individual 

client where funds are not co-mingled at the FI, the 

FI should establish the identity of the underlying 

client(s) in addition to that of the solicitor opening 

the account. 

## 4. 9 Special requirements in h igh risk situations 44  

> s.15,
> Sch.2

4. 9.1 An FI must comply with the special requirements set 

out in section 15 of Schedule 2 in: 

(a) a situation that by its nature may present a high 

risk of ML/TF taking into account the list of non-

exhaustive illustrative risk indicators which may 

indicate higher ML/TF risks set out in Appendix 

A; or 

(b) a situation specified by the RA in a notice in 

writing given to the FI.  

> s.15,
> Sch. 2

4.9.2 Section 15 of Schedule 2 specifies that an FI must, 

in any situation that by its nature presents a high 

risk of ML/TF, comply with the special requirements 

set out therein which include: 

(a) obtaining the approval of senior management to 

establish a business relationship , or continue an

existing business relationship where the 

relationship subsequently presents a high risk of 

ML/TF; and 

(b) either: 

(i) taking reasonable measures to establish the 

relevant customer’s or beneficial owner’s 

source of wealth and the source of the funds 

that will be involved in the business 

relationship 45 ; or 

(ii) taking additional measures to mitigate the 

risk of ML/TF. 

4.9 .3 For illustration purposes, additional measures to 

mitigate the risk of ML/TF may include the examples 

of possible enhanced measures set out in 

paragraph 2 of Appendix C. 

## 4.10 Customer not physically present for identification 

## purposes 

4.10.1 FIs must apply equally effective customer 

identification procedures and ongoing monitoring 

standards for customers not physically present for 

identification purposes as for those where the 

customer is available for interview 46 . Where a

customer has not been physically present for 

identification purposes, FIs will generally not be able 

to determine that the documentary evidence of 

identity actually relates to the customer they are 

dealing with. Consequently, there are increased 

risks. 

Special requirements 

> s.5(3)(a),
> s.5(4) &
> s.9(1),
> Sch. 2

4.10.2 The AMLO permits FIs to establish business 

relationship through various channels, both face-to-

face (e.g. branch) and non-face-to-face (e.g. 

internet). However, an FI should take additional 

measures to mitigate any risk (e.g. impersonation    

> 45 Guidance on source of wealth and source of funds are provided in paragraphs 4.11.13 and

risk) associated with customers not physically 

present for identification purposes. Except for the 

situation specified in paragraph 4.10.3, if a customer 

has not been physically present for identification 

purposes, the FI must carry out at least one of the 

following additional measures to mitigate the risks 

posed: 

(a) further verifying the customer’s identity on the 

basis of documents, data or information referred 

to in section 2(1)(a) of Schedule 2 but not 

previously used for the purposes of verification 

of the customer’s identity under that section; 

(b) taking supplementary measures to verify 

information relating to the customer that has 

been obtained by the FI; or 

(c) ensuring that the payment or, if there is more 

than one payment, the first payment made in 

relation to the customer’s account is carried out 

through an account opened in the customer’s 

name with an authorized institution, or an 

institution that: 

(i) is incorporated or established in an 

equivalent jurisdiction; 

(ii) carries on a business similar to that carried 

on by an authorized institution; 

(iii) has measures in place to ensure 

compliance with requirements similar to 

those imposed under Schedule 2; and 

(iv) is supervised for compliance with those 

requirements by authorities in that 

jurisdiction that perform functions similar to 

those of the HKMA.  

> s.9(2),
> Sch. 2

4.10.3 If an FI has verified the identity of the customer on 

the basis of data or information provided by a digital 

identification system that is a reliable and 

independent source that is recognised by the RA 

(see paragraph 4.2.1(d)), the FI is not required to 

carry out any of the additional measures set out in 

paragraph 4.10.2. July 2012 59 

4.10.4 The extent of additional measures set out in 

paragraph 4.10.2 will depend on the nature and 

characteristics of the product or service requested 

and the assessed ML/TF risk presented by the 

customer. 

4.10.5 Paragraph 4.10.2(b) allows an FI to utilise different 

methods to mitigate the risk. These may include 

measures such as (i) use of an independent and 

appropriate person to certify identification 

documents 47 ; (ii) checking relevant data against 

reliable databases or registries; or (iii) using 

appropriate technology, etc. Whether a particular 

measure or a combination of measures is 

acceptable should be assessed on a case-by-case 

basis. The FI should ensure and be able to 

demonstrate to the RA that the supplementary 

measure(s) taken can adequately guard against 

impersonation risk. 

4.10.6 For the avoidance of doubt, LCs should also comply 

with the relevant provisions (presently paragraph 

5.1) in the Code of Conduct for Persons Licensed 

by or Registered with the Securities and Futures 

Commission, having regard to the acceptable non-

face-to-face account opening approaches as well as 

relevant circulars and frequently asked questions 

published by the SFC from time to time. 

Other considerations 

4.10.7 While the requirements to undertake additional 

measures generally apply to a customer that is a 

natural person, increased risk may arise if a

customer that is not a natural person establishes a 

business relationship with an FI through a non-face-

to-face channel, for example when the natural 

person acting on behalf of the customer to establish 

the business relationship is not physically present    

> 47 Further guidance on the use of an independent and appropriate person to certify identification
> documents is set out in paragraph 7 of Appendix C. July 2012 60

for identification purposes. In such a case, the FI 

should mitigate the increased risk (e.g. applying 

additional due diligence measures set out in 

paragraph 4.10.2 to such natural person, except 

where the FI has verified the identity of the natural 

person on the basis of data or information provided 

by a digital identification system (see paragraph 

4.2.1(d))). In addition, where an FI is provided with 

copies of documents for identifying and verifying a 

legal person customer’s identity, an FI should also 

mitigate any increased risk (e.g. applying additional 

due diligence measures set out in paragraph 

4.10.2). 

## 4. 11 Politically exposed persons (PEPs) 

General  

> s.1 & s.10,
> Sch. 2

4.11.1 Much international attention has been paid in recent 

years to the risk associated with providing financial 

and business services to those with a prominent 

political profile or holding senior public office. 

However, PEP status itself does not automatically 

mean that the individuals are corrupt or that they 

have been incriminated in any corruption. 

4.11.2 However, their office and position may render PEPs 

vulnerable to corruption. The risks increase when 

the person concerned is from a foreign country with 

widely-known problems of bribery, corruption and 

financial irregularity within their governments and 

society. This risk is even more acute where such 

countries do not have adequate AML/CFT 

standards. 

4.11.3 An FI should implement appropriate risk 

management systems to identify PEPs. Under-

classification of PEPs poses a higher ML/TF risk to 

the FI whilst over-classification of PEPs leads to an 

unnecessary compliance burden to the FI and its 

customers.  

> s.15,
> Sch. 2

4.11.4 While the statutory definition of PEPs in the AMLO 

(see paragraph 4.11.7 below) only includes July 2012 61 

individuals entrusted with prominent public function 

in a place outside Hong Kong, Hong Kong PEPs 

and international organisation PEPs may also 

present, by virtue of the positions they hold, a higher 

ML/TF risk. FIs should therefore adopt an RBA to 

determine whether to apply the measures in 

paragraph 4.11.12 below in respect of Hong Kong 

PEPs and international organisation PEPs. 

> s.1,
> s.5(3)(b) &
> (c), s.10 &
> s.15,
> Sch. 2

4.11.5 The statutory definition does not automatically 

exclude sub-national political figures. Corruption by 

heads of regional governments, regional 

government ministers and large city mayors is no 

less serious as sub-national figures in some 

jurisdictions may h ave access to substantial funds. 

Where FIs identify a customer as a sub-national 

figure holding a prominent public function, they 

should apply appropriate measures set out in 

paragraph 4.11.12. 

4.11.6 The definitions of PEPs set out in paragraphs 

4.11.7, 4.11.20 and 4.11.21 provide some non-

exhaustive examples of the types of prominent 

(public) functions that an individual may be or may 

have been entrusted with by a government, or by an 

international organisation respectively. An FI should 

provide sufficient guidance and examples to its staff 

to enable them to identify all types of PEPs. In 

determining what constitutes a prominent (public) 

function, an FI should consider on a case-by-case 

basis taking into account various factors, for 

example: the powers and responsibilities associated 

with particular public function; the organisational 

framework of the relevant government or 

international organisation; and any other specific 

concerns connected to the jurisdiction where the 

public function is/has been entrusted. 

Non-Hong Kong PEPs 

Definition  

> s.1,
> Sch. 2

4.11.7 A PEP (hereafter referred to as “non-Hong Kong 

PEP”) is defined as: July 2012 62 

(a) an individual who is or has been entrusted with 

a prominent public function in a place outside 

Hong Kong and 

(i) includes a head of state, head of 

government, senior politician, senior 

government, judicial or military official, 

senior executive of a state-owned 

corporation and an important political party 

official; 

(ii) but does not include a middle-ranking or 

more junior official of any of the categories 

mentioned in subparagraph (i); 

(b) a spouse, a partner, a child or a parent of an 

individual falling within paragraph (a) above, or 

a spouse or a partner of a child of such an 

individual; or 

(c) a close associate of an individual falling within 

paragraph (a) (see paragraph 4.11.8).  

> s.1,
> Sch. 2

4.11.8 A close associate is defined as: 

(a) an individual who has close business relations 

with a person falling under paragraph 4.11.7(a) 

above, including an individual who is a

beneficial owner of a legal person or trust of 

which the person falling under paragraph 

4.11.7(a) is also a beneficial owner; or 

(b) an individual who is the beneficial owner of a 

legal person or trust that is set up for the benefit 

of a person falling under paragraph 4.11.7(a) 

above. 

Identification of non-Hong Kong PEPs  

> s.19(1),
> Sch. 2

4.11.9 An FI must establish and maintain effective 

procedures (e.g. by making reference to publicly 

available information and/or screening against 

commercially available databases) for determining 

whether a customer or a beneficial owner of a

customer is a non-Hong Kong PEP. July 2012 63 

4.11.10 While an FI may refer to commercially available 

databases to identify non-Hong Kong PEPs, the use 

of these databases should never replace traditional 

CDD processes (e.g. understanding the occupation 

and employer of a customer). When using 

commercially available databases, an FI should be 

aware of their limitations, for example, the 

databases are not necessarily comprehensive or 

reliable as they generally draw solely from 

information that is publicly available; the definition of 

non-Hong Kong PEPs used by the database 

providers may or may not align with the definition of 

non-Hong Kong PEPs applied by the FI; and any 

technical incapability of such databases that may 

hinder the FI’s effectiveness of non-Hong Kong PEP 

identification. An FI using such databases as a 

support tool should ensure that they are fit for the 

purpose. 

4.11.11 FIs may use publicly available information or refer to 

relevant reports and databases on corruption risk 

published by specialised national, international, non-

governmental and commercial organisations to 

assess which countries are most vulnerable to 

corruption (an example of which is Transparency 

International’s “Corruption Perceptions Index”, which 

ranks countries according to their perceived level of 

corruption). 

FIs should be vigilant where either the country to 

which the customer has business connections or the 

business/industrial sector is more vulnerable to 

corruption. 

Special requirements and additional measures for non-Hong Kong PEPs 

> s.5(3)(b) &
> s.10(1) &
> (2),
> Sch. 2

4.11.12 When an FI knows that a customer or beneficial 

owner of a customer is a non-Hong Kong PEP, it 

should, before (i) establishing a business 

relationship or (ii) continuing an existing business 

relationship where the customer or the beneficial 

owner is subsequently found to be a non -Hong July 2012 64 

Kong PEP, apply all the following measures: 

(a) obtaining approval from its senior management 

for establishing or continuing such business 

relationship 48 ;

(b) taking reasonable measures to establish the 

customer’s or the beneficial owner’s source of 

wealth and the source of the funds; and 

(c) conducting enhanced ongoing monitoring on 

that business relationship (see Chapter 5). 

4.11.13 Source of wealth refers to the origin of an 

individual’s entire body of wealth (i.e. total assets). 

This information will usually give an indication as to 

the size of wealth the customer would be expected 

to have, and a picture of how the individual acquired 

such wealth. Although an FI may not have specific 

information about assets not deposited with or 

processed by it, it may be possible to gather general 

information from the individual, commercial 

databases or other open sources. Examples of 

information and documents which may be used to 

establish source of wealth include evidence of title, 

copies of trust deeds, audited financial statements, 

salary details, tax returns and bank statements. 

4.11.14 Source of funds refers to the origin of the particular 

funds or other assets which are the subject of the 

business relationship between an individual and the 

FI (e.g. the amounts being invested, deposited, or 

wired as part of the business relationship). Source 

of funds information should not simply be limited to 

knowing from where the funds may have been 

transferred, but also the activity that generates the 

funds. The information obtained should be 

substantive and establish a provenance or reason 

for the funds having been acquired; e.g. salary 

payments and investment sale proceeds.   

> 48 As a general rule, the approval seniority should be proportionate to the risks associated with the
> PEP and the related business relationship. July 2012 65

4.11.15 It is for an FI to decide which measures it deems 

reasonable, in accordance with its assessment of 

the risks, to establish the source of funds and 

source of wealth. In practical terms, this will often 

amount to obtaining information from the non-Hong 

Kong PEP and verifying it against publicly available 

information sources such as asset and income 

declarations, which some jurisdictions expect certain 

senior public officials to file and which often include 

information about an official’s source of wealth and 

current business interests. FIs should however note 

that not all declarations are publicly available and 

that a non-Hong Kong PEP customer may have 

legitimate reasons for not providing a copy. FIs 

should also be aware that some jurisdictions impose 

restrictions on their PEP’s ability to hold foreign 

bank accounts or to hold other office or paid 

employment. 

4.11.16 Although the measures set out in paragraph 4.11.12 

also apply to family members and close associates 

of the non-Hong Kong PEP, the risks associated 

with them may vary depending to some extent on 

the social-economic and cultural structure of the 

jurisdiction of the non-Hong Kong PEP. 

4.11.17 Since not all non-Hong Kong PEPs pose the same 

level of ML/TF risks, an FI should adopt an RBA in 

determining the extent of measures in paragraph 

4.11.12 taking into account relevant factors, such 

as: 

(a) the prominent public functions that a non-Hong 

Kong PEP holds; 

(b) the geographical risk associated with the 

jurisdiction where a non-Hong Kong PEP holds 

prominent public functions; 

(c) the nature of the business relationship (e.g. the 

delivery/distribution channel used; or the 

product or service offered); and 

(d) in relation to a former non -Hong Kong PEP, the July 2012 66 

risk factors specified in paragraph 4.11.19. 

Treatment of former non-Hong Kong PEPs  

> s.1,
> Sch. 2

4.11.18 A former non-Hong Kong PEP is defined as: 

(a) an individual who, being a non-Hong Kong PEP, 

has been but is not currently entrusted with a 

prominent public function in a place outside 

Hong Kong; 

(b) a spouse, a partner, a child or a parent of an 

individual falling within paragraph (a) above, or a 

spouse or a partner of a child of such an 

individual; or 

(c) a close associate of an individual falling within 

paragraph (a) (see paragraph 4.11.8).

4.11.19 An FI should adopt an RBA 49 and may decide not to 

apply, or not to continue to apply, the measures set 

out in paragraph 4.11.12 to a former non-Hong Kong 

PEP who no longer presents a high risk of ML/TF 

after stepping down. 

To determine whether a former non-Hong Kong PEP 

no longer presents a high risk of ML/TF, the FI 

should conduct an appropriate assessment of the 

ML/TF risk associated with the previous PEP status 

taking into account various risk factors, including but 

not limited to: 

(a) the level of (informal) influence that the 

individual could still exercise; 

(b) the seniority of the position that the individual 

held as a non-Hong Kong PEP; and 

(c) whether the individual’s previous and current 

functions are linked in any way (e.g. formally by 

appointment of the former non-Hong Kong 

PEP’s successor, or informally by the fact that 

the former non-Hong Kong PEP continues to

deal with the same substantive matters). 

Hong Kong PEPs and international organisation PEPs 

Definition 

4.11.20 For the purposes of this Guideline, a “Hong Kong 

PEP” refers to: 

(a) an individual who is or has been entrusted with 

a prominent public function in Hong Kong and 

(i) includes head of government, senior 

politician, senior government or judicial 

official, senior executive of a government-

owned corporation and an important political 

party official; 

(ii) but does not include a middle-ranking or 

more junior official of any of the categories 

mentioned in subparagraph (i); 

(b) a spouse, a partner, a child or a parent of an 

individual falling within paragraph (a) above, or 

a spouse or a partner of a child of such an 

individual; or 

(c) a close associate of an individual falling within 

paragraph (a) (see paragraph 4.11.8). 

4.11.21 For the purposes of this Guideline, an “international 

organisation PEP” refers to: 

(a) an individual who is or has been entrusted with 

a prominent function by an international 

organisation, and 

(i) includes members of senior management, 

i.e. directors, deputy directors and members 

of the board or equivalent functions; 

(ii) but does not include a middle-ranking or 

more junior official of the international 

organisation; 

(b) a spouse, a partner, a child or a parent of an 

individual falling within paragraph (a) above, or 

a spouse or a partner of a child of such an 

individual; or 

(c) a close associate of an individual falling within July 2012 68 

paragraph (a) (see paragraph 4.11.8). 

4.11.22 International organisations referred to in paragraph 

4.11.21 are entities established by formal political 

agreements between their member States that have 

the status of international treaties; their existence is 

recognised by law in their member countries; and 

they are not treated as resident institutional units of 

the countries in which they are located. Examples 

of international organisations include the UN and 

affiliated international organisations such as the 

International Maritime Organization; regional 

international organisations such as the Council of 

Europe, institutions of the European Union, the 

Organization for Security and Co-operation in 

Europe and the Organization of American States; 

military international organisations such as the North 

Atlantic Treaty Organization; and economic 

organisations such as the World Trade Organization 

and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations; 

etc. 

Identification of and additional measures for Hong Kong PEPs and 

international organisation PEPs 

4.11.23 An FI should take reasonable measures to 

determine whether a customer or a beneficial owner 

of a customer is a Hong Kong PEP or an 

international organisation PEP 50 .

4.11.24 FIs should apply the measures specified in 

paragraph 4.11.12 with reference to the guidance 

provided in paragraphs 4.11.13 to 4.11.17 in any of 

the following situations 51 :                

> 50 Reference should be made to paragraphs 4.11.9 and 4.11.10.
> 51 For the avoidance of doubt, an FI should consider whether the application of special
> requirements in paragraph 4.11.12 could mitigate the ML/TF risk arising from the high risk
> business relationship with a Hong Kong PEP or an international organisation PEP. Where
> applicable, an FI should also take additional measures to mitigate such risk in accordance with
> the guidance provided in paragraphs 4.9.2 and 4.9.3.

July 2012 69 

(a) before establishing a high risk business 

relationship 52 with a customer who is or whose 

beneficial owner is a Hong Kong PEP or an 

international organisation PEP; 

(b) when continuing an existing business 

relationship with a customer who is or whose 

beneficial owner is a Hong Kong PEP or an 

international organisation PEP where the 

relationship subsequently becomes high risk; or 

(c) when continuing an existing high risk business 

relationship where the FI subsequently knows 

that the customer or the beneficial owner of the 

customer is a Hong Kong PEP or an 

international organisation PEP. 

Treatment of former Hong Kong PEPs or former international 

organisation PEPs 

4.11.25 In the situations described in paragraph 4.11.24, an 

FI should adopt an RBA 53 and may decide not to 

apply, or not to continue to apply, the measures set 

out in paragraph 4.11.12 to a Hong Kong PEP or an 

international organisation PEP who has been but 

not currently entrusted with a prominent (public) 

function (hereafter referred to as “former Hong Kong 

PEP” or “former international organisation PEP”) 54 

and no longer presents a high risk of ML/TF after 

stepping down. 

To determine whether a former Hong Kong PEP or 

a former international organisation PEP no longer 

presents a high risk of ML/TF, the FI should conduct 

an appropriate assessment of the ML/TF risk 

associated with the previous PEP status taking into 

account various risk factors, including but not limited     

> 52 In determining whether a business relationship presents a high ML/TF risk, an FI should take

to: 

(a) the level of (informal) influence that the 

individual could still exercise; 

(b) the seniority of the position that the individual 

held as a Hong Kong PEP or an international 

organisation PEP; and 

(c) whether the individual’s previous and current 

functions are linked in any way (e.g. formally by 

appointment of the successor of the former 

Hong Kong PEP or the former international 

organisation PEP, or informally by the fact that 

the former Hong Kong PEP or the former 

international organisation PEP continues to deal 

with the same substantive matters). 

## 4.1 2 Bearer shares and nominee shareholders 

Bearer shares 55  

> s.15,
> Sch. 2

4.12.1 Bearer shares refer to negotiable instruments that 

accord ownership in a legal person to the person 

who possesses the physical bearer share certificate, 

and any other similar instruments without 

traceability. Therefore it is more difficult to establish 

the beneficial ownership of a company with bearer 

shares. An FI should adopt procedures to establish 

the identities of the beneficial owners of such shares 

and ensure that the FI is notified whenever there is 

a change of beneficial owner of such shares. 

4.12.2 Where bearer shares have been deposited with an 

authorised/registered custodian, FIs should seek 

independent evidence of this, for example 

confirmation from the registered agent that an 

authorised/registered custodian holds the bearer 

shares, together with the identities of the 

authorised /registered custodian and the person who    

> 55 For the avoidance of doubt, paragraphs 4.12.1 to 4.12.3 also apply to bearer share warrants,
> which refer to negotiable instruments that accord entitlement to ownership in a legal person to
> the person who possesses the physical bearer share warrant certificate, and any other similar
> warrants or instruments without traceability. In this regard, the reference to “bearer shares” or
> “shares” should also be read as “bearer share warrants” or “share warrants” respectively. July 2012 71

has the right to those entitlements carried by the 

share. As part of the FI’s ongoing periodic review, it 

should obtain evidence to confirm the 

authorised/registered custodian of the bearer 

shares. 

4.12.3 Where the shares are not deposited with an 

authorised/registered custodian, the FI should 

obtain declarations prior to account opening and 

annually thereafter from each beneficial owner of 

such shares. FIs should also require the customer 

to notify it immediately of any changes in the 

ownership of the shares. 

Nominee shareholders 

4.12.4 For a customer identified to have nominee 

shareholders in its ownership structure, an FI should 

obtain satisfactory evidence of the identities of the 

nominees, and the persons on whose behalf they 

are acting, as well as the details of arrangements in 

place, in order to determine who the beneficial 

owner is. 

## 4.1 3 Jurisdictions posing a higher risk 

4.13.1 FIs should give particular attention to, and exercise 

extra care in respect of: 

(a) business relationships and transactions with 

persons (including legal persons and other FIs) 

from or in jurisdictions identified by the FATF as 

having strategic AML/CFT deficiencies; and 

(b) transactions and business connected with 

jurisdictions assessed as higher risk. 

In such case, the special requirements of section 15 

of Schedule 2 may apply (see paragraphs 4.9). 

4.13.2 In determining which jurisdictions are identified by 

the FATF as having strategic AML/CFT deficiencies, 

or may otherwise pose a higher risk, FIs should 

consider, among other things: July 2012 72 

(a) countries or jurisdictions identified by credible 

sources, such as mutual evaluation or detailed 

assessment reports, as not having effective 

AML/CFT Systems; 

(b) countries or jurisdictions identified by credible 

sources as having a significant level of 

corruption or other criminal activity; 

(c) countries or jurisdictions subject to sanctions, 

embargoes or similar measures issued by, for 

example, the UN; or 

(d) countries, jurisdictions or geographical areas 

identified by credible sources as providing 

funding or support for terrorist activities, or that 

have designated terrorist organisations 

operation. 

“Credible sources” refers to information that is 

produced by well-known bodies that generally are 

regarded as reputable and that make such 

information publicly and widely available. In 

addition to the FATF and FATF-style regional 

bodies, such sources may include, but are not 

limited to, supra-national or international bodies 

such as the International Monetary Fund, and the 

Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units, as 

well as relevant national government bodies and 

non-government organisations. 

## 4.14 Jurisdictions subject to a call by the FATF  

> s.15,
> Sch. 2

4.14.1 An FI should apply additional measures, 

proportionate to the risks and in accordance with the 

guidance provided in paragraphs 4.9, to business 

relationships and transactions with natural and legal 

persons, and FIs, from jurisdictions for which this is 

called for by the FATF. July 2012 73  

> s.15,
> Sch. 2

4.14.2 Where mandatory enhanced measures or 

countermeasures 56 are called for by the FATF, or in 

other circumstances independent of any call by the 

FATF but also considered to be higher risk, RA may 

also, through a notice in writing: 

(a) impose a general obligation on FIs to comply 

with the special requirements set out in section 

15 of Schedule 2; or 

(b) require FIs to undertake specific 

countermeasures identified or described in the 

notice. 

The type of measures in paragraphs (a) and (b) 

above would be proportionate to the nature of the 

risks and/or deficiencies. 

## 4.15 Reliance on CDD performed by intermediaries 

General  

> s.18,
> Sch. 2

4.15.1 An FI may rely upon an intermediary to perform any 

part of the CDD measures 57 specified in section 2 of 

Schedule 2, subject to the criteria set out in section 

18 of Schedule 2. However, the ultimate 

responsibility for ensuring that CDD requirements 

are met remains with the FI. 

In a third-party reliance scenario, the third party will 

usually have an existing business relationship with 

the customer, which is independent from the 

relationship to be formed by the customer with the 

relying FI, and would apply its own procedures to 

perform the CDD measures. 

4.15.2 For the avoidance of doubt, reliance on 

intermediaries does not apply to outsourcing or    

> 56 For jurisdictions with serious deficiencies in applying the FATF Recommendations and where
> inadequate progress has been made to improve their position, the FATF may recommend the
> application of countermeasures.
> 57 For the avoidance of doubt, an FI cannot rely on an intermediary to continuously monitor its
> business relationship with a customer for the purpose of complying with the requirements in
> section 5 of Schedule 2. July 2012 74

agency relationships, in which the outsourced entity 

or agent applies the CDD measures on behalf of the 

FI, in accordance with the FI’s procedures, and 

subject to the FI’s control of effective 

implementation of these procedures by the 

outsourced entity or agent.  

> s.18(1),
> Sch. 2

4.15.3 When relying on an intermediary, the FI must: 

(a) obtain written confirmation from the intermediary 

that the intermediary agrees to act as the FI’s 

intermediary and perform which part of the CDD 

measures specified in section 2 of Schedule 2; 

and 

(b) be satisfied that the intermediary will on request 

provide a copy of any document, or a record of 

any data or information, obtained by the 

intermediary in the course of carrying out the 

CDD measures without delay.  

> s.18(4)(a),
> Sch. 2

4.15.4 An FI that carries out a CDD measure by means of 

an intermediary must immediately after the 

intermediary has carried out that measure, obtain 

from the intermediary the data or information that 

the intermediary has obtained in the course of 

carrying out that measure, but nothing in this 

paragraph requires the FI to obtain at the same time 

from the intermediary a copy of the document, or a 

record of the data or information, that is obtained by 

the intermediary in the course of carrying out that 

measure.  

> s.18(4)(b),
> Sch. 2

4.15.5 Where these documents and records are kept by 

the intermediary, the FI should obtain an 

undertaking from the intermediary to keep all 

underlying CDD information throughout the 

continuance of the FI’s business relationship with 

the customer and for at least five years beginning 

on the date on which the business relationship of a 

customer with the FI ends or until such time as may 

be specified by the RA. The FI must ensure that the July 2012 75 

intermediary will, if requested by the FI within the 

period specified in the record-keeping requirements 

of AMLO, provide to the FI a copy of any document, 

or a record of any data or information, obtained by 

the intermediary in the course of carrying out that 

measure as soon as reasonably practicable after 

receiving the request. The FI should also obtain an 

undertaking from the intermediary to supply copies 

of all underlying CDD information in circumstances 

where the intermediary is about to cease trading or 

does not act as an intermediary for the FI anymore. 

4.15.6 An FI should conduct sample tests from time to time 

to ensure CDD information and documentation is 

produced by the intermediary upon demand and 

without undue delay. 

4.15.7 Whenever an FI has doubts as to the reliability of 

the intermediary, it should take reasonable steps to 

review the intermediary’s ability to perform its CDD 

duties. If the FI intends to terminate its relationship 

with the intermediary, it should immediately obtain 

all CDD information from the intermediary. If the FI 

has any doubts regarding the CDD measures 

carried out by the intermediary previously, the FI 

should perform the required CDD as soon as 

reasonably practicable. 

Domestic intermediaries 

> s.18(3)(a),
> (3)(b) & (7),
> Sch. 2

4.15.8 An FI may rely upon any one of the following 

domestic intermediaries, to perform any part of the 

CDD measures set out in section 2 of Schedule 2: 

(a) an FI that is an authorized institution, a licensed 

corporation, an authorized insurer, a licensed 

individual insurance agent, a licensed insurance 

agency or a licensed insurance broker company 

(intermediary FI); 

(b) an accounting professional meaning: 

(i) a certified public accountant as defined by 

section 2(1) of the Professional Accountants July 2012 76 

Ordinance (Cap. 50), or a certified public 

accountant (practising) as defined by section 

2(1) of the Accounting and Financial 

Reporting Council Ordinance (Cap. 588); 

(ii) a corporate practice as defined by section 

2(1) of the Accounting and Financial 

Reporting Council Ordinance (Cap. 588); or 

(iii) a CPA firm as defined by section 2(1) of the 

Accounting and Financial Reporting Council 

Ordinance (Cap. 588); 

(c) an estate agent meaning: 

(i) a licensed estate agent as defined by 

section 2(1) of the Estate Agents Ordinance 

(Cap. 511); or 

(ii) a licensed salesperson as defined by 

section 2(1) of the Estate Agents Ordinance 

(Cap. 511); 

(d) a legal professional meaning: 

(i) a solicitor as defined by section 2(1) of the 

Legal Practitioners Ordinance (Cap. 159); or 

(ii) a foreign lawyer as defined by section 2(1) 

of the Legal Practitioners Ordinance (Cap. 

159); or 

(e) a trust or company service provider (TCSP) 

licensee meaning: 

(i) a person who holds a licence granted under 

section 53G or renewed under section 53K 

of the AMLO; or 

(ii) a deemed licensee as defined by section 

53ZQ(5) of the AMLO, 

provided that in the case of an accounting 

professional, an estate agent, a legal professional or 

a TCSP licensee, the FI is satisfied that the 

domestic intermediary has adequate procedures in 

place to prevent ML/TF and is required to comply July 2012 77 

with the relevant requirements set out in Schedule 2 

with respect to the customer 58 .

> s.18(3)(a)
> & (3)(b),
> Sch. 2

4.15.9 An FI should take appropriate measures to ascertain 

if the domestic intermediary satisfies the criteria set 

out in paragraph 4.15.8, which may include: 

(a) where the domestic intermediary is an 

accounting professional, an estate agent, a legal 

professional or a TCSP licensee, ascertaining 

whether the domestic intermediary is required to 

comply with the relevant requirements set out in 

Schedule 2 with respect to the customer; 

(b) making enquiries concerning the domestic 

intermediary’s stature or the extent to which any 

group AML/CFT standards are applied and 

audited; or 

(c) reviewing the AML/CFT policies and procedures 

of the domestic intermediary. 

Overseas intermediaries  

> s.18(3)(c),
> Sch. 2

4.15.10 An FI may rely upon an overseas intermediary 59 

carrying on business or practising in an equivalent 

jurisdiction 60 to perform any part of the CDD 

measures set out in section 2 of Schedule 2, where 

the intermediary: 

(a) falls into one of the following categories of 

businesses or professions: 

(i) an institution that carries on a business 

similar to that carried on by an intermediary 

FI; 

(ii) a lawyer or a notary public; 

(iii) an auditor, a professional accountant, or a 

tax advisor;     

> 58 CDD requirements set out in Schedule 2 apply to an accounting professional, an estate agent, a
> legal professional or a TCSP licensee with respect to a customer only when it, by way of
> business, prepares for or carries out for the customer a transaction specified under section 5A
> of the AMLO.
> 59 The overseas intermediary and the FI could be unrelated or within the same group of companies
> to which the FI belongs.
> 60 Guidance on jurisdictional equivalence is provided in paragraphs 4.19. July 2012 78

(iv) a trust or company service provider; 

(v) a trust company carrying on trust business; 

and 

(vi) a person who carries on a business similar 

to that carried on by an estate agent; 

(b) is required under the law of the jurisdiction 

concerned to be registered or licensed or is 

regulated under the law of that jurisdiction; 

(c) has measures in place to ensure compliance 

with requirements similar to those imposed 

under Schedule 2; and 

(d) is supervised for compliance with those 

requirements by an authority in that jurisdiction 

that performs functions similar to those of any of 

the RAs or the regulatory bodies (as may be 

applicable). 

4.15.11 An FI should take appropriate measures to ascertain 

if the overseas intermediary satisfies the criteria set 

out in paragraph 4.15.10. Appropriate measures 

that should be taken to ascertain if the criterion set 

out in paragraph 4.15.10(c) is satisfied may include: 

(a) making enquiries concerning the overseas 

intermediary’s stature or the extent to which any 

group’s AML/CFT standards are applied and 

audited; or 

(b) reviewing the AML/CFT policies and procedures 

of the overseas intermediary. 

Related foreign financial institutions as intermediaries 

> s.18(3)(d),
> (3A) & (7),
> Sch. 2

4.15.12 An FI may also rely upon a related foreign financial 

institution (related foreign FI) to perform any part of 

the CDD measures set out in section 2 of Schedule 

2, if the related foreign FI: 

(a) carries on, in a place outside Hong Kong, a 

business similar to that carried on by an 

intermediary FI; and falls within any of the 

following descriptions: 

(i) it is within the same group of companies as July 2012 79 

the FI; 

(ii) if the FI is incorporated in Hong Kong, it is a 

branch of the FI; 

(iii) if the FI is incorporated outside Hong Kong: 

(A) it is the head office of the FI; or 

(B) it is a branch of the head office of the FI; 

(b) is required under group policy: 

(i) to have measures in place to ensure 

compliance with requirements similar to the 

requirements imposed under Schedule 2; 

and 

(ii) to implement programmes against ML/TF; 

and 

(c) is supervised for compliance with the 

requirements mentioned in paragraph (b) at a 

group level: 

(i) by an RA; or 

(ii) by an authority in an equivalent jurisdiction 61 

that performs, in relation to the holding 

company or the head office of the FI, 

functions similar to those of an RA under the 

AMLO. 

> s.18(3A) &
> (4)(c),
> Sch. 2

4.15.13 The group policy set out in paragraph 4.15.12(b) 

refers to a policy of the group of companies to which 

the FI belongs and the policy applies to the FI and 

the related foreign FI. The group policy should 

include CDD and record-keeping requirements 

similar to the requirements imposed under Schedule 

2 and group-wide AML/CFT Systems 62 (e.g. 

compliance and audit functions) to ensure 

compliance with those requirements. The group 

policy should also be able to mitigate adequately 

any higher country risk in relation to the jurisdiction 

where the related foreign FI is located. The FI 

should be satisfied that the related foreign FI is 

subject to regular and independent reviews over its 

ongoing compliance with the group policy conducted    

> 61 Guidance on jurisdictional equivalence is provided in paragraphs 4.19.
> 62 Reference should be made to Chapter 3. July 2012 80

by any group-level compliance, audit or other similar 

AML/CFT functions.  

> s.18(3A),
> Sch. 2

4.15.14 The FI should be able to demonstrate that the 

implementation of the group policy is supervised at 

a group level by either an RA or an authority in an 

equivalent jurisdiction that performs functions similar 

to those of an RA under the AMLO, which practises 

group-wide supervision which extends to the related 

foreign FI. 

## 4.16 Pre -existing customers  

> s.6,
> Sch. 2

4.16.1 FIs must perform the CDD measures prescribed in 

Schedule 2 and this Guideline in respect of pre-

existing customers (with whom the business 

relationship was established before the AMLO came 

into effect on 1 April 2012), when: 

(a) a transaction takes place with regard to the 

customer, which is, by virtue of the amount or 

nature of the transaction, unusual or suspicious; 

or is not consistent with the FI’s knowledge of 

the customer or the customer’s business or risk 

profile, or with its knowledge of the source of the 

customer’s funds; 

(b) a material change occurs in the way in which 

the customer’s account is operated; 

(c) the FI suspects that the customer or the 

customer’s account is involved in ML/TF; or 

(d) the FI doubts the veracity or adequacy of any 

information previously obtained for the purpose 

of identifying the customer or for the purpose of 

verifying the customer’s identity. 

4.16.2 Trigger events may include the re-activation of a 

dormant account or a change in the beneficial 

ownership or control of the account but FIs will need 

to consider other trigger events specific to their own 

customers and business.  

> s.5,
> Sch. 2

4.16.3 FIs should note that requirements for ongoing July 2012 81 

monitoring under section 5 of Schedule 2 also apply 

to pre-existing customers (see Chapter 5). 

## 4.17 Failure to satisfactorily complete CDD measures  

> s.3(4),
> Sch. 2

4.17.1 Where an FI is unable to complete the CDD 

measures in accordance with paragraph 4.1.9 or 

4.7.1, the FI: 

(a) must not establish a business relationship or 

carry out any occasional transaction with that 

customer; or 

(b) must terminate the business relationship as 

soon as reasonably practicable if the FI has 

already established a business relationship with 

the customer. 

The FI should also assess whether this failure 

provides grounds for knowledge or suspicion of 

ML/TF and where there is relevant knowledge or 

suspicion, should make an STR to the JFIU in 

relation to the customer. 

## 4.18 Prohibition on anonymous accounts  

> s.16,
> Sch. 2

4.18.1 FIs must not open, or maintain, any anonymous 

account or account in fictitious names for any 

customer. Besides, confidential numbered 

accounts 63 should not function as anonymous 

accounts, rather they should be subject to exactly 

the same CDD and control measures 64 as all other 

business relationships. While a numbered account 

can offer additional confidentiality for the customer, 

the identity of the customer should be verified by the 

FI and known to a sufficient number of staff to 

facilitate effective CDD and ongoing monitoring. In 

all cases, whether the relationship involves 

numbered accounts or not, the customer ’s CDD                   

> 63 In a confidential numbered account, the name of the customer (and/or the beneficial owner) is
> known to the FI but is substituted by an account number or code name in subsequent
> documentation.
> 64 For example, wire transfers from numbered accounts should reflect the real name of the
> account holder. July 2012 82

record must be available to the RAs, other 

authorities, the CO, auditors, and other staff with 

appropriate authority. 

## 4.19 Jurisdictional equivalence 

General 

> s.4(3)(b)(i),
> s.4(3)(d)(iii),
> s.4(3)(f),
> s.9(1)(c)(ii)
> & s.18(3)(c),
> Sch. 2

4.19.1 Jurisdictional equivalence and the determination of 

equivalence is an important aspect in the application 

of CDD measures under the AMLO. Equivalent 

jurisdiction is defined in the AMLO as meaning: 

(a) a jurisdiction that is a member of the FATF, 

other than Hong Kong; or 

(b) a jurisdiction that imposes requirements similar 

to those imposed under Schedule 2. 

Determination of jurisdictional equivalence 

4.19.2 An FI may therefore be required to evaluate and 

determine for itself which jurisdictions other than 

FATF members apply requirements similar to those 

imposed under Schedule 2 for jurisdictional 

equivalence purposes. The FI should document its 

assessment of the jurisdiction, and include 

consideration of the following factors: 

(a) whether the jurisdiction concerned is a member 

of FATF-style regional bodies and its recent 

mutual evaluation report published by the FATF-

style regional bodies 65 ;

(b) whether the jurisdiction concerned is identified 

by the FATF as having strategic AML/CFT 

deficiencies and the recent progress of 

improving its AML/CFT regime; 

(c) any advisory circulars issued by RAs from time 

to time alerting FIs to such jurisdictions with 

poor AML/CFT controls; or 

(d) any other AML/CFT related publications that are 

published by specialised national, international,

non-governmental or commercial organisations 

(for example, Transparency International’s 

“Corruption Perceptions Index”, which ranks 

countries according to their perceived level of 

corruption). 

4.19.3 As the AML/CFT regime of a jurisdiction will change 

over time, an FI should review the jurisdictional 

equivalence assessment from time to time. 

## 4.20 Cross -border correspondent relationships 

Introduction 

4.20.1 For the purposes of this Guideline, “cross-border 

correspondent relationships” refers to the provision 

of services for dealing in securities, dealing in 

futures contracts, or leveraged foreign exchange 

trading 66 , by an FI 67 (hereafter referred to as 

“correspondent institution”) to another financial 

institution 68 located in a place outside Hong Kong 

(hereafter referred to as “respondent institution”), 

where transactions effected on a principal or agency 

basis under the business relationships are initiated 

by the respondent institution. 

4.20.2 An FI may establish cross-border correspondent 

relationships with respondent institutions around the 

world. An example of cross-border correspondent 

relationship is where a securities firm located in 

Hong Kong, as a correspondent institution, executes 

securities transactions on a stock exchange for a 

securities firm operating outside Hong Kong, which 

acts as a respondent institution for its underlying

local customers. 

4.20.3 Where a respondent institution conducts business 

for or on behalf of customers through a cross-border 

correspondent relationship with an FI, the FI 

normally has limited information regarding the 

underlying customers and the nature or purpose of 

the underlying transactions because it generally 

does not have direct relationships with the 

underlying customers of the respondent institution. 

This will expose the FI to risks stemming from the 

lack or incompleteness of information about the 

underlying customers and transactions.

> s.23(b),

4.20.4 An FI should establish and maintain effective 

procedures for mitigating the risks associated with 

cross-border correspondent relationships which may 

vary depending on a number of factors (see 

paragraph 4.20.6). 

Additional due diligence measures for cross-border correspondent 

relationships 

4.20.5 An FI must carry out CDD measures 69 in relation to 

a customer including a respondent institution. 

Although an FI is permitted not to identify and take 

reasonable measures to verify the identities of the 

beneficial owners 70 of a financial institution which 

meets the criteria set out in paragraph 4.8.3(b), the 

FI should apply the following additional due 

diligence measures when it establishes a cross-

border correspondent relationship to mitigate the 

associated risks: 

(a) collect sufficient information about the 

respondent institution to enable it to understand 

fully the nature of the respondent institution ’s    

> 69 Please refer to paragraph 4.1.4.
> 70 It includes the individuals who ultimately own or control the customer and the person(s) on
> whose behalf the customer is acting (e.g. underlying customer(s) of a customer that is an FI).
> For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of paragraphs 4.20 do not require an FI to conduct
> CDD on the underlying customers of a respondent institution. July 2012 85

business (see paragraph 4.20.7); 

(b) determine from publicly available information 

the reputation of the respondent institution and 

the quality of regulatory supervision over the 

respondent institution by authorities in the 

jurisdictions in which it operates and/or is 

incorporated which perform functions similar to 

those of the RAs (see paragraph 4.20.8); 

(c) assess the AML/CFT controls of the respondent 

institution and be satisfied that the AML/CFT 

controls of the respondent institution are 

adequate and effective (see paragraph 4.20.9); 

(d) obtain approval from its senior management 

(see paragraph 4.20.10); and 

(e) understand clearly the respective AML/CFT 

responsibilities of the FI and the respondent 

institution within the cross-border correspondent 

relationship (see paragraph 4.20.11). 

4.20.6 Given that not all cross-border correspondent 

relationships pose the same level of ML/TF risks, 

the FI should adopt an RBA in applying the 

additional due diligence measures stated above, 

taking into account relevant factors such as: 

(a) the purpose of the cross-border correspondent 

relationship, the nature and expected volume 

and value of transactions; 

(b) how the respondent institution will provide 

services to its underlying customers through the 

account maintained by the FI for the respondent 

institution (hereafter referred to as 

“correspondent account”), including the potential 

use of the account by other respondent 

institutions through a “nested” correspondent 

relationship 71 and the purpose, and the direct 

respondent institution’s control framework with 

respect to the “nested” correspondent   

> 71 Nested correspondent relationship refers to the use of a correspondent account by a number of
> respondent institutions through their relationships with the FI’s direct respondent institution, to
> conduct transactions and obtain access to other financial services. July 2012 86

relationship; 

(c) the types of underlying customers to whom the 

respondent institution intends to serve through 

the correspondent account, and the extent to 

which any of these underlying customers and 

their transactions are assessed as high risk by 

the respondent institution; and 

(d) the quality and effectiveness of the AML/CFT 

regulation as well as supervision by authorities 

in the jurisdictions in which the respondent 

institution operates and/or is incorporated 72 .

4.20.7 An FI should determine on a risk-sensitive basis the 

amount of information to collect about the 

respondent institution to enable it to understand the 

nature of the respondent institution’s business 

including the respondent institution’s management 

and ownership, the financial group to which the 

respondent institution belongs, major business 

activities, target markets, customer base and 

locations of customers. The FI may make reference 

to publicly available information to understand the 

respondent institution’s business (e.g. where 

applicable, its corporate website, annual reports 

filed with stock exchanges, reputable newspapers 

and journals). 

4.20.8 When determining from publicly available 

information (e.g. public databases of regulatory and 

enforcement actions, news media sources or other 

types of open source information) the reputation of 

the respondent institution and the quality of 

regulatory supervision over the respondent 

institution, consideration should be given to whether 

and when the respondent institution has been 

subject to any targeted financial sanction, ML/TF             

> 72 Consideration may be given to country assessment reports and other relevant information
> published by international bodies (including the FATF, FATF-style regional bodies, the
> International Monetary Fund and the World Bank) which measure AML/CFT compliance and
> address ML/TF risks, lists issued by the FATF in the context of its International Cooperation
> Review Group process, ML/TF risk assessments and other relevant public information from
> national authorities. July 2012 87

investigation or regulatory action. 

4.20.9 When assessing the AML/CFT controls of the 

respondent institution and ascertaining whether 

these controls are adequate and effective, the FI 

should have regard to the AML/CFT measures of 

the jurisdictions in which the respondent institution 

operates and/or is incorporated, and whether the 

AML/CFT controls of the respondent institution are 

subject to an independent audit. 

Information for assessing the AML/CFT controls 

may first be obtained from the respondent 

institution, for example, by way of a due diligence 

questionnaire, to facilitate the information collection 

and risk assessment processes. 

A more in-depth review of the respondent 

institution’s AML/CFT controls should be conducted 

for any cross-border correspondent relationship that 

presents higher risks, possibly by interviewing 

compliance officers, conducting an on-site visit or 

reviewing the findings reported by internal or 

external auditors. 

4.20.10 An FI should obtain approval from its senior 

management before establishing a cross-border 

correspondent relationship. In this regard, the level 

of seniority of the member of an FI’s senior 

management in making such approval should be 

commensurate with the assessed ML/TF risk. 

4.20.11 An FI should clearly understand the respective 

AML/CFT responsibilities of the FI and the 

respondent institution within the cross-border 

correspondent relationship, including the type and 

nature of services to be provided under the cross-

border correspondent relationship, the respondent 

institution’s responsibilities concerning compliance 

with AML/CFT requirements, and the conditions 

regarding the provision of documents, data or July 2012 88 

information on particular transactions and (where 

applicable) the underlying customers which should 

be provided by the respondent institution upon the 

FI’s request. The level of detail may vary having 

regard to the nature of the cross-border 

correspondent relationship and the associated 

ML/TF risks. For example, an FI may also consider 

to impose potential restrictions on the use of the 

correspondent account by the respondent institution 

(e.g. limiting transaction types, volumes, etc.) in 

accordance with its terms of business when the 

ML/TF risks become higher. 

Direct access to the correspondent account by the underlying customers 

of a respondent institution 

4.20.12 Where a respondent institution meets the criteria set 

out in paragraph 4.8.3(b) and its underlying 

customers not being the customers of the FI (having 

regard to the definition of “customer” in paragraph 

4.1.6) are allowed to directly access and operate the 

correspondent account 73 , the FI should take further 

steps 74 and be satisfied that the respondent 

institution: 

(a) has conducted CDD on the underlying 

customers having direct access to the 

correspondent account, including verifying their 

identities and continuously monitoring its 

business relationships with them, in accordance 

with requirements similar to those imposed 

under the AMLO; and 

(b) will, upon the FI’s request, provide documents, 

data or information obtained by the respondent     

> 73 For example, where an FI provides its electronic trading system for a respondent institution

institution in relation to those customers in 

accordance with requirements similar to those 

imposed under the AMLO. 

Ongoing monitoring  

> s.5(1)(a),
> Sch. 2

4.20.13 An FI should monitor the cross-border 

correspondent relationship in accordance with the 

guidance set out in Chapter 5, including: 

(a) on a regular basis and/or upon trigger events, 

reviewing the information obtained by the FI 

from applying the additional due diligence 

measures under paragraph 4.20.5 in the course 

of establishing the cross-border correspondent 

relationship with the respondent institution 75 ,

together with other existing CDD records of the 

respondent institution, to ensure that the 

documents, data and information of the 

respondent institution obtained are up-to-date 

and relevant; and 

(b) monitoring transactions of the respondent 

institution with a view to detecting any 

unexpected or unusual activities or transactions, 

and any changes in the risk profile of the 

respondent institution for compliance with 

AML/CFT measures and applicable targeted 

financial sanctions. 

Where unusual activities or transactions are 

detected, the FI should follow up with the 

respondent institution by making a request for 

information on any particular transactions, and 

where applicable, more information on the

July 2012 90 

underlying customers of the respondent institution 

on a risk-sensitive basis 76 .

Cross-border correspondent relationships with related foreign financial 

institutions 

4.20.14 Where a cross-border correspondent relationship is 

established with a related foreign financial 

institution, an FI may adopt a streamlined approach 

to applying additional due diligence measures and 

other risk mitigating measures for the cross-border 

correspondent relationship. The FI may rely on its 

group AML/CFT programme for this purpose. 

It may be sufficient for the FI to demonstrate its 

compliance with the requirements set out in 

paragraphs 4.20.5 to 4.20.13 by performing a

documented assessment and satisfying itself that: 

(a) the group policy which applies to the respondent 

institution includes: 

(i) CDD, continuous monitoring of business 

relationships and record-keeping 

requirements similar to the requirements 

imposed under Schedule 2; 

(ii) the AML/CFT responsibilities of the 

respondent institution within the cross-

border correspondent relationship; and 

(iii) group-wide AML/CFT Systems (including 

the compliance and audit functions, the 

provision of customer, account and 

transaction information to the FI’s group-

level compliance, audit or AML/CFT 

functions and the sharing of such

information for the purposes of CDD and 

ML/TF risk management 77 ) which monitor 

and regularly review the effective 

implementation of CDD, continuous 

monitoring of business relationships and 

record-keeping requirements by the 

respondent institution and support effective 

group-wide ML/TF risk management; 

(b) the group policy is able to adequately mitigate 

any higher risk factors including country risk, 

customer risk, product/service/transaction risk, 

and delivery/distribution channel risk to which 

the respondent institution is exposed throughout 

the business relationship; and 

(c) the effective implementation of the group policy 

and group-wide AML/CFT Systems is 

supervised at the group level by a competent 

authority. 

The aforesaid assessment should be approved by 

an MIC of AML/CFT, MIC of Compliance or other 

appropriate senior management personnel. 

Cross-border correspondent relationships involving shell financial 

institutions 

4.20.15 An FI must not establish or continue a cross-border 

correspondent relationship with a shell financial 

institution. 

The FI should also take appropriate measures to 

satisfy itself that its respondent institutions do not 

permit their correspondent accounts to be used by 

shell financial institutions 78 .                

> 77 This should include information and analysis of transactions or activities which appear unusual

> 78 This includes a nested correspondent relationship under which the respondent institution uses
> the correspondent account to provide services to a shell financial institution with which it has a
> business relationship.

July 2012 92 

4.20.16 For the purposes of this Guideline, a shell financial 

institution is a corporation that: 

(a) is incorporated in a place outside Hong Kong; 

(b) is authorised to carry on financial services 

businesses 79 in that place; 

(c) does not have a physical presence in that place 

(see paragraph 4.20.17); and 

(d) is not an affiliate 80 of a regulated financial group 

that is subject to effective group-wide 

supervision. 

4.20.17 A corporation is considered to have a physical 

presence 81 in a place or jurisdiction if: 

(a) the corporation carries on financial services 

businesses at any premises in that place or 

jurisdiction; and 

(b) at least one full-time employee of the 

corporation performs duties related to financial 

services businesses at those premises. 

Other group-wide considerations 

4.20.18 If an FI relies on a financial institution within the 

same group of companies (related FI) to establish a 

cross-border correspondent relationship and 

perform the additional due diligence and other risk 

mitigating measures set out in paragraphs 4.20.5 to 

4.20.12 and 4.20.15, the FI should ensure that its 

related FI has taken into account the FI’s own 

specific circumstances and business arrangements, 

and its particular cross-border correspondent 

relationship with the respondent institution. The

ultimate responsibility for ensuring that the 

additional due diligence and other relevant 

requirements are met remains with the FI. 

4.20.19 If an FI has cross-border correspondent 

relationships with several respondent institutions in 

different jurisdictions that belong to the same 

financial group, the FI whilst assessing each of the 

cross-border correspondent relationships 

independently should also take into account that 

these respondent institutions belong to the same 

group. July 2012 94 

# Chapter 5 - ONGOING MONITORING 

## General  

> s.5(1),
> Sch. 2

5.1 Ongoing monitoring is an essential component of 

effective AML/CFT Systems. 

An FI must continuously monitor its business 

relationship with a customer by: 

(a) reviewing from time to time documents, data and 

information relating to the customer that have 

been obtained by the FI for the purpose of 

complying with the requirements imposed under 

Part 2 of Schedule 2 to ensure that they are up-

to-date and relevant; 

(b) conducting appropriate scrutiny of transactions 

carried out for the customer to ensure that they 

are consistent with the FI’s knowledge of the 

customer, the customer’s business, risk profile 

and source of funds; and 

(c) identifying transactions that 

(i) are complex, unusually large in amount or of 

an unusual pattern; and 

(ii) have no apparent economic or lawful 

purpose, 

and examining the background and purposes of 

those transactions and setting out the findings in 

writing. 

## Keeping customer information up -to -date  

> s.5(1)(a),
> Sch. 2

5.2 To ensure documents, data and information of a

customer obtained are up-to-date and relevant 82 , an 

FI should undertake reviews of existing CDD records 

of customers on a regular basis and/or upon trigger 

events 83 . Clear policies and procedures should be

> 83 While it is not necessary to regularly review the existing CDD records of a dormant customer, an

developed, especially on the frequency of periodic 

review or what constitutes a trigger event 84 .

5.3 All customers that present high ML/TF risks should 

be subject to a minimum of an annual review, or 

more frequent reviews if deemed necessary by the 

FI, to ensure the CDD information retained remains 

up-to-date and relevant. 

## Transaction monitoring systems and processes  

> s.19(3),
> Sch.2

5.4 An FI should establish and maintain adequate 

systems and processes (e.g. the use of large 

transactions exception reports which help an FI to 

stay apprised of operational activities) to monitor 

transactions. The design, degree of automation and 

sophistication of transaction monitoring systems and 

processes should be developed appropriately having 

regard to the following factors: 

(a) the size and complexity of its business; 

(b) the ML/TF risks arising from its business; 

(c) the nature of its systems and controls; 

(d) the monitoring procedures that already exist to 

satisfy other business needs; and 

(e) the nature of the products and services provided 

(which includes the means of delivery or 

communication). 

5.5 An FI should ensure that the transaction monitoring 

systems and processes can provide all relevant staff 

who are tasked with conducting transaction 

monitoring and investigation with timely and sufficient 

information required to identify, analyse and 

effectively monitor customers’ transactions. 

5.6 An FI should ensure that the transaction monitoring 

systems and processes can support the ongoing 

monitoring of a business relationship in a holistic 

approach, which may include monitoring activities of   

> 84 Examples of trigger events are set out in paragraph 8 of Appendix C. July 2012 96

a customer’s multiple accounts within or across lines 

of business, and related customers’ accounts within 

or across lines of business. This means preferably 

the FI adopts a relationship-based approach rather 

than on a transaction-by-transaction basis. 

5.7 In designing transaction monitoring systems and 

processes, including (where applicable) setting of 

parameters and thresholds, an FI should take into 

account the transaction characteristics, which may 

include: 

(a) the nature and type of transactions (e.g. 

abnormal size or frequency); 

(b) the nature of a series of transactions (e.g. 

structuring a single transaction into a number of 

cash deposits); 

(c) the counterparties of transactions; 

(d) the geographical origin/destination of a payment 

or receipt; and 

(e) the customer’s normal account activity or 

turnover. 

5.8 An FI should regularly review the adequacy and 

effectiveness of its transaction monitoring systems 

and processes, including (where applicable) 

parameters and thresholds adopted. The 

parameters and thresholds should be properly 

documented and independently validated to ensure 

that they are appropriate to its operations and 

context. 

## Risk -based approach to monitoring  

> s.5(4) & (5),
> Sch. 2

5.9 FIs should conduct ongoing monitoring in relation to 

all business relationships following the RBA. The 

extent of monitoring (e.g. frequency and intensity of 

monitoring) should be commensurate with the ML/TF 

risk profile of the customer. Where the ML/TF risks 

are higher, the FI should conduct enhanced 

monitoring. In lower risk situations, the FI may 

reduce the extent of monitoring. July 2012 97  

> s.5(3),
> Sch. 2

5.10 FIs must take additional measures to compensate for 

any risk of ML/TF in monitoring business 

relationships involving (a) a customer not having 

been physically present for identification purposes; 

(b) a customer or a beneficial owner of a customer 

being a non-Hong Kong PEP; and (c) a customer or 

a beneficial owner of a customer being involved in a 

situation referred to in section 15 of Schedule 2. 

5.11 FIs should be vigilant for changes of the basis of the 

business relationship with the customer over time. 

These may include where: 

(a) new products or services that pose higher risk 

are entered into; 

(b) new corporate or trust structures are created; 

(c) the stated activity or turnover of a customer 

changes or increases; or 

(d) the nature of transactions changes or their 

volume or size increases, etc. 

5.12 Where the basis of the business relationship 

changes significantly, FIs should carry out further 

CDD procedures to ensure that the ML/TF risk 

involved and basis of the relationship are fully 

understood. Ongoing monitoring procedures must 

take account of the above changes. 

Review of transactions 

> s.5(1)(b) &
> (c),
> Sch. 2

5.13 An FI should take appropriate steps (e.g. examining 

the background and purposes of the transactions; 

making appropriate enquiries to or obtaining 

additional CDD information from a customer) to 

identify if there are any grounds for suspicion, when: 

(a) the customer’s transactions are not consistent 

with the FI’s knowledge of the customer, the 

customer’s business, risk profile or source of 

funds; 

(b) the FI identifies transactions that (i) are complex, 

unusually large in amount or of an unusual July 2012 98 

pattern, and (ii) have no apparent economic or 

lawful purpose 85 .

5.14 Where the FI conducts enquiries and obtains what it 

considers to be a satisfactory explanation of the 

activity or transaction, it may conclude that there are 

no grounds for suspicion, and therefore take no 

further action. Even if no suspicion is identified, the 

FI should consider updating the customer risk profile 

based on any relevant information obtained. 

5.15 However, where the FI cannot obtain a satisfactory 

explanation of the transaction or activity, it may 

conclude that there are grounds for suspicion. In any 

event where there is any suspicion identified during 

transaction monitoring, an STR should be made to 

the JFIU. 

5.16 An FI should be aware that making enquiries to 

customers, when conducted properly and in good 

faith, will not constitute tipping-off. However, if the FI 

reasonably believes that performing the CDD 

process will tip off the customer, it may stop pursuing 

the process. The FI should document the basis for 

its assessment and file an STR to the JFIU. 

5.17 The findings and outcomes of steps taken by the FI 

in paragraph 5.13, as well as the rationale of any 

decision made after taking these steps, should be 

properly documented in writing and be available to 

RAs, other competent authorities and auditors. 

5.18 Where cash transactions (including deposits and 

withdrawals) and third-party deposits and payments 

are being proposed by customers, and such requests 

are not in accordance with the customer’s profile and 

normal commercial practice s, FIs must approach   

> 85 An FI should examine the background and purposes of the transactions and set out its findings
> in writing. July 2012 99

such situations with caution and make relevant 

further enquiries 86 .

5.19 Ongoing monitoring of a customer’s account 

involving cash, third-party deposits and payments 

should be enhanced. An FI should be alert to the red 

flags relating to cash and third-party transactions, 

having regard to the list of illustrative indicators of 

suspicious transactions and activities set out in 

Appendix B. 

5.20 Where the FI has been unable to satisfy itself that 

any cash transaction or third-party deposit or 

payment is reasonable, and therefore considers it 

suspicious, it should make an STR to the JFIU.  

> 86 Guidance on third-party deposits and payments is provided in Chapter 11. 100

# Chapter 6 – TERRORIST FINANCING, FINANCIAL 

# SANCTIONS AND PROLIFERATION 

# FINANCING 

## Terrorist financing 

6.1 TF is the financing of terrorist acts, and of terrorists 

and terrorist organisations. It generally refers to the 

carrying out of transactions involving property owned 

by terrorists or terrorist organisations, or that has 

been, or is intended to be, used to assist the 

commission of terrorist acts. Different from ML, the 

focus of which is on the handling of criminal 

proceeds (i.e. the source of property is what 

matters), the focus of TF is on the destination or use 

of property, which may have derived from legitimate 

sources.

6.2 The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has 

passed UNSCR 1373 (2001), which calls on all 

member states to act to prevent and suppress the 

financing of terrorist acts. The UN has also 

published the names of individuals and organisations 

in relation to involvement with Al-Qa’ida, ISIL 

(Da’esh) and the Taliban under relevant UNSCRs 

(e.g. UNSCR 1267 (1999), 1988 (2011), 1989 

(2011), 2253 (2015), 2368 (2017) and their 

successor resolutions). All UN member states are 

required to freeze any funds, or other financial 

assets, or economic resources of any person(s) 

named in these lists and to report any suspected 

name matches to the relevant authorities. 

6.3 UNATMO is an ordinance to further implement a

decision under UNSCR 1373 (2001) relating to 

measures for prevention of terrorist acts and a

decision under UNSCR 2178 (2014) relating to the 

prevention of travel for the purpose of terrorist acts or 

terrorist training; as well as to implement certain 

terrorism-related multilateral conventions and certain 

FATF Recommendations. 101

6.4 Where a person or property is designated by a

Committee of the UNSC established pursuant to the 

relevant UNSCRs as stated in paragraph 6.2 as a 

terrorist/terrorist associate or terrorist property 87 

respectively, the Chief Executive may publish a

notice in the Gazette specifying the name of the 

person or the property under section 4 of the 

UNATMO. Besides, section 5 of the UNATMO 

provides that the Chief Executive may make an 

application to the Court of First Instance for an order 

to specify a person or property as a terrorist/terrorist 

associate or terrorist property respectively, and if the 

order is made, it will also be published in the 

Gazette.

> s.8A & s.11L,
> UNATMO

6.5 A number of provisions in the UNATMO are of 

particular relevance to FIs, and are listed below. 

(a) section 6 empowers the Secretary for Security (S 

for S) to freeze suspected terrorist property; 

(b) section 7 prohibits the provision or collection of 

property for use to commit terrorist acts; 

(c) section 8 prohibits any person from making 

available or collecting or soliciting property or 

financial (or related) services for terrorists and 

terrorist associates; 

(d) section 8A prohibits any person from dealing with 

any property knowing that, or being reckless as 

to whether, the property is specified terrorist 

property or property of a specified terrorist or 

terrorist associate; and 

(e) section 11L prohibits any person from providing 

or collecting any property to finance the travel of 

a person between states with the intention or 

knowing that the travel will be for a specified 

purpose, i.e. the perpetration, planning or 

preparation of, or participation in, one or more 

terrorist acts (even if no terrorist act actually  

> 87 According to section 2 of the UNATMO, terrorist property means the property of a terrorist or
> terrorist associate, or any other property that is intended to be used or was used to finance or
> assist the commission of terrorist acts. 102

occurs); or the provision or receiving of training 

that is in connection with the perpetration, 

planning or preparation of, or participation in, one 

or more terrorist acts (even if no terrorist act 

actually occurs as a result of the training).

> s.8A(1),
> UNATMO

6.6 The S for S can licence exceptions to the prohibitions 

to enable frozen property to be unfrozen and to allow 

payments to be made to or for the benefit of a

designated party under the UNATMO (e.g. 

reasonable living/legal expenses and payments liable 

to be made under the Employment Ordinance). An 

FI seeking such a licence should write to the Security 

Bureau. 

## Financial sanctions & proliferation financing  

> s.3(1),
> UNSO

6.7 UNSO empowers the Chief Executive to make 

regulations to implement sanctions decided by the 

UNSC, including targeted financial sanctions 88 

against certain persons and entities designated by 

the UNSC or its Committees. Designated persons 

and entities are specified by notice published in the 

Gazette or on the website of the Commerce and 

Economic Department Bureau. Except under the 

authority of a licence granted by the Chief Executive, 

it is an offence: 

(a) to make available, directly or indirectly, any 

funds, or other financial assets, or economic 

resources, to, or for the benefit of, (i) designated 

persons or entities, (ii) persons or entities acting 

on behalf or at the direction of the designated 

persons or entities mentioned in (i), or (iii) entities 

owned or controlled by any persons or entities 

mentioned in (i) or (ii); or 

(b) to deal with, directly or indirectly, any funds or 

other financial assets or economic resources 

belonging to, or owned or controlled by, persons

6.8 The Chief Executive may grant a licence for making 

available any funds or other financial assets or 

economic resources to; or dealing with any funds or 

other financial assets or economic resources 

belonging to, or owned or controlled by, persons or 

entities falling within paragraph 6.7(a) under 

specified circumstances in accordance with the 

provisions of the relevant regulation made under the 

UNSO. An FI seeking such a licence should write to 

the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau. 

6.9 To combat PF , the UNSC ad opts a two -tiered 

approach through resolutions made under Chapter 

VII of the UN Charter imposing mandatory 

obligations on UN member states: (a) global 

approach under UNSCR 1540 (2004) and its 

successor resolutions; and (b) country-specific 

approach under UNSCR 1718 (2006) against the 

Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) and 

UNSCR 2231 (2015) against the Islamic Republic of 

Iran (Iran) and their successor resolutions.  

> s.4,
> WMD(CPS)O

6.10 The counter PF regime in Hong Kong is implemented 

through legislation, including the regulations made 

under the UNSO which are specific to DPRK and 

Iran, and the WMD(CPS)O. Section 4 of 

WMD(CPS)O prohibits a person from providing any 

services where he believes or suspects, on 

reasonable grounds, that those services may be 

connected to PF. The provision of services is widely 

defined and includes the lending of money or other 

provision of financial assistance. 

Sanctions imposed by other jurisdictions 

6.11 While FIs do not normally have any obligation under 

Hong Kong laws to have regard to unilateral 

sanctions imposed by other organisations or 

authorities in other jurisdictions, an FI operating 

internationally will need to be aware of the scope and 

focus of relevant sanctions regimes in those 

jurisdictions. Where these sanctions regimes may 104 

affect their operations, FIs should consider what 

implications exist and take appropriate measures. 

## Database maintenance, screening and enhanced 

## checking 

6.12 An FI should establish and maintain effective 

policies, procedures and controls to ensure 

compliance with the relevant regulations and 

legislation on TF, financial sanctions and PF. The 

legal and regulatory obligations of FIs and those of 

their staff should be well understood and adequate 

guidance and training should be provided to the 

latter. 

6.13 It is particularly vital that an FI should be able to 

identify terrorist suspects and possible designated 

parties, and detect prohibited transactions. To this 

end, an FI should ensure that it maintains a database 

of names and particulars of terrorists and designated 

parties which consolidates the various lists that have 

been made known to the FI. Alternatively, an FI may 

make arrangements to access to such a database 

maintained by third party service providers and take 

appropriate measures (e.g. conduct sample testing 

periodically) to ensure the completeness and 

accuracy of the database. 

6.14 Whether or not a UNSCR or sanctions list has been 

implemented through Hong Kong legislation, there 

are offences under existing legislation relating to ML, 

TF and PF that are relevant. Inclusion of a country, 

individual, entity or activity in the UNSCR or 

sanctions list may constitute grounds for knowledge 

or suspicion for the purposes of relevant ML, TF and 

PF laws, thereby triggering statutory (including 

reporting) obligations as well as offence provisions. 

RAs draw to the attention to FIs from time to time 

whenever there are any updates to the UNSCRs or 

sanctions lists relating to terrorism, TF and PF 

promulgated by the UNSC. The FI should ensure 

that countries, individuals and entities included in 105 

UNSCRs and sanctions lists are included in the 

database as soon as practicable after they are 

promulgated by the UNSC and regardless of whether 

the relevant sanctions have been implemented by 

legislation in Hong Kong. 

6.15 An FI should include in its database (i) the lists 

published in the Gazette or on the website of the 

Commerce and Economic Development Bureau; and 

(ii) the lists that RAs draw to the attention of FIs from 

time to time. The database should be subject to 

timely update whenever there are changes, and 

should be made easily accessible by relevant staff. 

6.16 To avoid establishing business relationship or 

conducting transactions with any terrorist suspects 

and possible persons or entities falling within 

paragraph 6.7(a), an FI should implement an 

effective screening mechanism 89 , which should 

include: 

(a) screening its customers and any beneficial 

owners of the customers against current 

database at the establishment of the relationship; 

(b) screening its customers and any beneficial 

owners of the customers against all new and any 

updated designations to the database as soon as 

practicable; and 

(c) screening all relevant parties in a cross-border 

wire transfer against current database before 

executing the transfer. 

6.17 The screening requirements set out in paragraph 

6.16 (a) and (b) should extend to other connected 

parties as defined in paragraph 4.2.13 and PPTAs of 

a customer using an RBA. 

6.18 When possible name matches are identified during 

screening, an FI should conduct enhanced checks to  

> 89 Screening should be carried out irrespective of the risk profile attributed to the customer. 106

determine whether the possible matches are genuine 

hits. In case of any suspicions of TF, PF or sanction 

violations, the FI should make a report to the JFIU. 

Records of enhanced checking results, together with 

all screening records, should be documented, or 

recorded electronically. 

6.19 An FI may rely on its overseas office to maintain the 

database or to undertake the screening process. 

However, the FI is reminded that the ultimate 

responsibility for ensuring compliance with the 

relevant regulations and legislation on TF, financial 

sanctions and PF remains with the FI. 107 

# Chapter 7 – SUSPICIOUS TRANSACTION 

# REPORTS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT 

# REQUESTS 

## General issues 

> s.25A(1) &
> (7),
> DTROP &
> OSCO,
> s.12(1) &
> s.14(5),
> UNATMO

7.1 It is a statutory obligation under sections 25A(1) of 

the DTROP and the OSCO, as well as section 12(1) 

of the UNATMO, that where a person knows or 

suspects that any property: (a) in whole or in part 

directly or indirectly represents any person’s 

proceeds of, (b) was used in connection with, or (c) 

is intended to be used in connection with, drug 

trafficking or an indictable offence; or that any 

property is terrorist property, the person shall as 

soon as it is reasonable for him to do so, file an STR 

with the JFIU. The STR should be made together 

with any matter on which the knowledge or suspicion 

is based. Under the DTROP, the OSCO and the 

UNATMO, failure to report knowledge or suspicion 

carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for three 

months and a fine of $50,000. 

## Knowledge vs. suspicion 

7.2 Generally speaking, knowledge is likely to include: 

(a) actual knowledge; 

(b) knowledge of circumstances which would 

indicate facts to a reasonable person; and 

(c) knowledge of circumstances which would put a 

reasonable person on inquiry. 

7.3 Suspicion is more subjective. Suspicion is personal 

and falls short of proof based on firm evidence. As 

far as an FI is concerned, when a transaction or a 

series of transactions of a customer is not consistent 

with the FI’s knowledge of the customer, or is 

unusual (e.g. in a pattern that has no apparent 

economic or lawful purpose), the FI should take 

appropriate steps to further examine the transactions 

and identify if there is any suspicion (see paragraphs 

5.13 to 5.20). 108 

7.4 For a person to have knowledge or suspicion, he 

does not need to know the nature of the criminal 

activity underlying the ML, or that the funds 

themselves definitely arose from the criminal 

offence. Similarly, the same principle applies to TF. 

7.5 Once knowledge or suspicion has been formed, 

(a) an FI should file an STR even where no 

transaction has been conducted by or through 

the FI 90 ; and 

(b) the STR must be made as soon as reasonably 

practical after the suspicion was first identified. 

Tipping-off 

> s.25A(5),
> DTROP &
> OSCO,
> s.12(5),
> UNATMO

7.6 It is an offence (“tipping-off”) to reveal to any person 

any information which might prejudice an 

investigation; if a customer is told that a report has 

been made, this would prejudice the investigation 

and an offence would be committed. 

The tipping-off provision includes circumstances 

where a suspicion has been raised internally within 

an FI, but has not yet been reported to the JFIU. 

## AML/CFT Systems in relation to suspicious transaction 

## reporting 

7.7 An FI should implement appropriate AML/CFT 

Systems in order to fulfil its statutory reporting 

obligation, and properly manage and mitigate the 

risks associated with any customer or transaction 

involved in an STR. The AML/CFT Systems should 

include: 

(a) appointment of an MLRO (see Chapter 3); 

(b) implementing clear polici es and procedures over      

> 90 The reporting obligations require a person to report suspicions of ML/TF, irrespective of the
> amount involved. The reporting obligations of section 25A(1) DTROP and OSCO and section
> 12(1) UNATMO apply to “any property”. These provisions establish a reporting obligation
> whenever a suspicion arises, without reference to transactions per se. Thus, the obligation to
> report applies whether or not a transaction was actually conducted and also covers attempted
> transactions. 109

internal reporting, reporting to the JFIU, post-

reporting risk mitigation and prevention of 

tipping-off; and 

(c) keeping proper records of internal reports and 

STRs. 

7.8 The FI should have measures in place to check, on 

an ongoing basis, that its AML/CFT Systems in 

relation to suspicious transaction reporting comply 

with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and 

operate effectively. The type and extent of the 

measures to be taken should be appropriate having 

regard to the risk of ML/TF as well as the nature and 

size of the business. 

Money laundering reporting officer 

7.9 An FI should appoint an MLRO as a central 

reference point for reporting suspicious transactions 

and also as the main point of contact with the JFIU 

and law enforcement agencies. The MLRO should 

play an active role in the identification and reporting 

of suspicious transactions. Principal functions of the 

MLRO should include having oversight of: 

(a) review of internal disclosures and exception 

reports and, in light of all available relevant 

information, determination of whether or not it is 

necessary to make a report to the JFIU; 

(b) maintenance of all records related to such 

internal reviews; and 

(c) provision of guidance on how to avoid tipping-off. 

To fulfil these functions, all FIs must ensure that the 

MLRO receives full co-operation from all staff and 

full access to all relevant documentation so that he is 

in a position to decide whether attempted or actual 

ML/TF is suspected or known. 

Identifying suspicious transactions 

7.10 An FI should provide sufficient guidance to its staff to 

enable them to form suspicion or to recognise the 

signs when ML/TF is taking place. The guidance 110 

should take into account the nature of the 

transactions and customer instructions that staff is 

likely to encounter, the type of product or service 

and the means of delivery. 

7.11 An FI may adopt, where applicable, the “SAFE” 

approach promoted by the JFIU, which includes: (a) 

screening the account for suspicious indicators; (b) 

asking the customers appropriate questions; (c) 

finding out the customer’s records; and (d) 

evaluating all the above information. Details of the 

“SAFE” approach are available at JFIU’s website 

(www.jfiu.gov.hk). 

7.12 An FI should have reasonable policies and 

procedures to identify and analyse relevant red flags 

of suspicious activities for its customer accounts. A

list of non-exhaustive illustrative indicators of 

suspicious transactions and activities is provided in 

Appendix B to assist an FI in determining what types 

of red flags are relevant to its businesses, taking into 

account the nature of customer transactions, risk 

profile of the customers and business relationships. 

The list is intended solely to provide an aid to FIs, 

and must not be applied by FIs as a routine 

instrument without analysis or context. The 

detection of any relevant red flag by an FI however 

should prompt further investigations and be a

catalyst towards making at least initial enquiries 

about the source of funds. 

FIs should also be aware of elements of individual 

transactions and situations that might give rise to 

suspicion of TF in certain circumstances. The FATF 

publishes studies of methods and trends of TF from 

time to time, and FIs may refer to the FATF website 

for additional information and guidance. 

Internal reporting 

7.13 An FI should establish and maintain clear policies 

and procedures to ensure that: 111 

(a) all staff are made aware of the identity of the 

MLRO and of the procedures to follow when 

making an internal report; and 

(b) all internal reports must reach the MLRO without 

undue delay. 

7.14 While FIs may wish to set up internal systems that 

allow staff to consult with supervisors or managers 

before sending a report to the MLRO, under no 

circumstances should reports raised by staff be 

filtered out by supervisors or managers who have no 

responsibility for the money laundering 

reporting/compliance function. The legal obligation 

is to report as soon as it is reasonable to do so, so 

reporting lines should be as short as possible with 

the minimum number of people between the staff 

with the suspicion and the MLRO. This ensures 

speed, confidentiality and accessibility to the MLRO. 

> s.25A(4),
> DTROP &
> OSCO,
> s.12(4),
> UNATMO

7.15 Once a staff member of an FI has reported suspicion 

to the MLRO in accordance with the policies and 

procedures established by the FI for the making of 

such reports, the statutory obligation of the staff 

member has been fully satisfied. 

7.16 The internal report should include sufficient details of 

the customer concerned and the information giving 

rise to the suspicion. 

7.17 The MLRO should acknowledge receipt of an 

internal report and provide a reminder of the 

obligation regarding tipping-off to the reporting staff 

member upon internal reporting. 

7.18 When evaluating an internal report, the MLRO must 

take reasonable steps to consider all relevant 

information, including CDD and ongoing monitoring 

information available within or to the FI concerning 

the customers to which the report relates. This may 

include: 

(a) making a review of other transaction patterns 112 

and volumes through connected accounts, 

preferably adopting a relationship-based 

approach rather than on a transaction-by-

transaction basis; 

(b) making reference to any previous patterns of 

instructions, the length of the business 

relationship and CDD and ongoing monitoring 

information and documentation; and 

(c) appropriate questioning of the customer per the 

systematic approach to identify suspicious 

transactions recommended by the JFIU 91 .

7.19 The need to search for information concerning 

connected accounts or relationships should strike an 

appropriate balance between the statutory 

requirement to make a timely STR to the JFIU and 

any delays that might arise in searching for more 

relevant information concerning connected accounts 

or relationships. The review process should be 

documented, together with any conclusions drawn. 

Reporting to the JFIU 

7.20 If after completing the review of the internal report, 

the MLRO decides that there are grounds for 

knowledge or suspicion, he should disclose the 

information to the JFIU as soon as it is reasonable to 

do so after his evaluation is complete together with 

the information on which that knowledge or 

suspicion is based. 

Dependent on when knowledge or suspicion arises, 

an STR may be made either before a suspicious 

transaction or activity occurs (whether the intended 

transaction ultimately takes place or not), or after a 

transaction or activity has been completed. 

7.21 Providing a n MLRO acts in good faith in deciding not 

to file an STR with the JFIU, it is unlikely that there 

will be any criminal liability for failing to report if the 

MLRO concludes that there is no suspicion after  

> 91 For details, please see JFIU’s website (www.jfiu.gov.hk). 113

taking into account all available infor mation. It is 

however vital for the MLRO to keep proper records 

of the deliberations and actions taken to 

demonstrate he has acted in reasonable manner. 

7.22 In the event that an urgent reporting is required (e.g. 

where a customer has instructed the FI to move 

funds or other property, close the account, make 

cash available for collection, or carry out significant 

changes to the business relationship, etc.), 

particularly when the account is part of an ongoing 

law enforcement investigation, an FI should indicate 

this in the STR. Where exceptional circumstances 

exist in relation to an urgent reporting, an initial 

notification by telephone should be considered. 

7.23 An FI is recommended to indicate any intention to 

terminate a business relationship in its initial 

disclosure to the JFIU. 

7.24 An FI should ensure STRs filed with the JFIU are of 

high quality taking into account feedback and 

guidance provided by the JFIU and RAs from time to 

time. 

7.25 The JFIU recognises the importance of having 

effective feedback procedures in place and 

therefore, provides feedback both in its quarterly 

report 92 and other appropriate platform when 

needed. 

Post reporting matters 

> s.25A(2)(a),
> DTROP &
> OSCO,
> s.12(2B)(a),
> UNATMO

7.26 The JFIU will acknowledge receipt of an STR made 

by an FI under section 25A of both the DTROP and 

the OSCO, and section 12 of the UNATMO. If there 

is no need for imminent action, e.g. the issue of a 

restraint order on an account, consent will usually be

given for the institution to operate the account under 

the provisions of section 25A(2) of both the DTROP 

and the OSCO, and section 12(2B)(a) of the 

UNATMO. The JFIU may, on occasion, seek 

additional information or clarification with an FI of 

any matter on which the knowledge or suspicion is 

based. Otherwise, the FI should take appropriate 

action and seek legal advice where necessary. 

> s.25A(2),
> DTROP &
> OSCO,
> s.12(2),
> UNATMO

7.27 Filing a report to the JFIU provides FIs with a

statutory defence to the offence of ML/TF in respect 

of the acts disclosed in the report, provided: 

(a) the report is made before the FI undertakes the 

disclosed acts and the acts (transaction(s)) are 

undertaken with the consent of the JFIU; or 

(b) the report is made after the FI has performed the 

disclosed acts (transaction(s)) and the report is 

made on the FI’s own initiative and as soon as it 

is reasonable for the FI to do so. 

7.28 However, the statutory defence stated in paragraph 

7.27 does not absolve an FI from the legal, 

reputational or regulatory risks associated with the 

account’s continued operation. An FI should also be 

aware that a “consent” response from the JFIU to a 

pre-transaction report should not be construed as a 

“clean bill of health” for the continued operation of 

the account or an indication that the account does 

not pose a risk to the FI. 

7.29 An FI should conduct an appropriate review of a 

business relationship upon the filing of an STR to the 

JFIU, irrespective of any subsequent feedback 

provided by the JFIU, and apply appropriate risk 

mitigating measures. Filing a report with the JFIU 

and continuing to operate the relationship without 

any further consideration of the risks and the 

imposition of appropriate controls to mitigate the 

risks identified is not acceptable. If necessary, the 

issue should be escalated to the FI’s senior 

management to determine how to handle the 115 

relationship concerned to mitigate any potential legal 

or reputational risks posed by the relationship in line 

with the FI’s business objectives, and its capacity to 

mitigate the risks identified. 

7.30 An FI should be aware that the reporting of a

suspicion in respect of a transaction or event does 

not remove the need to report further suspicious 

transactions or events in respect of the same 

customer. Further suspicious transactions or 

events, whether of the same nature or different to 

the previous suspicion, must continue to be reported 

to the MLRO who should make further reports to the 

JFIU if appropriate. 

Record-keeping 

7.31 An FI must establish and maintain a record of all 

ML/TF reports made to the MLRO. The record 

should include details of the date the report was 

made, the staff members subsequently handling the 

report, the results of the assessment, whether the 

internal report resulted in an STR to the JFIU, and 

information to allow the papers relevant to the report 

to be located. 

7.32 An FI must establish and maintain a record of all 

STRs made to the JFIU. The record should include 

details of the date of the STR, the person who made 

the STR, and information to allow the papers 

relevant to the STR to be located. This register may 

be combined with the register of internal reports, if 

considered appropriate. 

## Requests from law enforcement agencies 

7.33 An FI may receive various requests from law 

enforcement agencies, e.g. search warrants, 

production orders, restraint orders or confiscation 

orders, pursuant to relevant legislation in Hong 

Kong. These requests are crucial to aid law 

enforcement agencies, to carry out investigations as 

well as restrain and confiscate illicit proceeds. 

Therefore, an FI should establish clear policies and 116 

procedures to handle these requests in an effective 

and timely manner, including allocation of sufficient 

resources. An FI should appoint a staff member as 

the main point of contact with law enforcement 

agencies. 

7.34 An FI should respond to any search warrant and 

production order within the required time limit by 

providing all information or materials that fall within 

the scope of the request. Where an FI encounters 

difficulty in complying with the timeframes stipulated, 

the FI should at the earliest opportunity contact the 

officer-in-charge of the investigation for further 

guidance. 

> s.10 & s.11,
> DTROP,
> s.15 & s.16,
> OSCO,
> s.6,
> UNATMO

7.35 During a law enforcement investigation, an FI may 

be served with a restraint order which prohibits the 

dealing with particular funds or property pending the 

outcome of an investigation. An FI must ensure that 

it is able to withhold the relevant property that is the 

subject of the order. It should be noted that the 

restraint order may not apply to all funds or property 

involved within a particular business relationship and 

FIs should consider what, if any, funds or property 

may be utilised subject to the laws of Hong Kong. 

> s.3,
> DTROP,
> s.8,
> OSCO,
> s.13,
> UNATMO

7.36 Upon the conviction of a defendant, a court may 

order the confiscation of his criminal proceeds and 

an FI may be served with a confiscation order in the 

event that it holds funds or other property belonging 

to that defendant that are deemed by the Courts to 

represent his benefit from the crime. A court may 

also order the forfeiture of property where it is 

satisfied that the property is terrorist property. 

7.37 When an FI receives a request from a law 

enforcement agency, e.g. search warrant or 

production order, in relation to a particular customer 

or business relationship, the FI should timely assess 

the risk involved and the need to conduct an 

appropriate review on the customer or the business 

relationship to determine whether there is any 117 

suspicion, and should also be aware that the 

customer subject to the request can be a victim of 

crime. 118 

# Chapter 8 – RECORD-KEEPING 

## General 

8.1 Record-keeping is an essential part of the audit trail 

for the detection, investigation and confiscation of 

criminal or terrorist property or funds. Record-

keeping helps the investigating authorities to 

establish a financial profile of a suspect, trace the 

criminal or terrorist property or funds and assists the 

Court to examine all relevant past transactions to 

assess whether the property or funds are the 

proceeds of or relate to criminal or terrorist offences. 

Record-keeping also enables an FI to demonstrate 

compliance with the requirements set out in the 

AMLO, this Guideline and other relevant guidance 

promulgated by the RAs from time to time. 

8.2 An FI should maintain CDD information, transaction 

records and other records that are necessary and 

sufficient to meet the statutory and regulatory 

requirements, that are appropriate to the nature, size 

and complexity of its businesses. The FI should 

ensure that: 

(a) the audit trail for funds moving through the FI that 

relate to any customer and, where appropriate, 

the beneficial owner of the customer, account or 

transaction is clear and complete; 

(b) all CDD information and transaction records are 

available swiftly to RAs, other authorities and 

auditors upon appropriate authority; and 

(c) it can demonstrate compliance with any relevant 

requirements specified in other sections of this 

Guideline and other guidelines issued by the 

RAs. 119 

## Retention of records relating to CDD and transactions 

> s.20(1)(b)(i),
> Sch. 2

8.3 An FI should keep: 

(a) the original or a copy of the documents, and a 

record of the data and information, obtained in 

the course of identifying and where applicable, 

verifying the identity of the customer and/or 

beneficial owner of the customer and/or 

beneficiary and/or persons who purport to act on 

behalf of the customer and/or other connected 

parties to the customer; 

(b) other documents and records obtained 

throughout the CDD and ongoing monitoring 

process, including SDD, situations where 

special requirements are required, additional 

due diligence measures and other requirements 

for cross-border correspondent relationships, 

and when taking simplified and enhanced 

measures 93 ; 

> s.2(1)(c),
> Sch. 2

(c) where applicable, the original or a copy of the 

documents, and a record of the data and 

information, on the purpose and intended nature 

of the business relationship;  

> s.20(1)(b)(ii),
> Sch. 2

(d) the original or a copy of the records and 

documents relating to the customer’s account 

(e.g. account opening form; risk assessment 

form 94 ) and business correspondence 95 with the 

customer and any beneficial owner of the 

customer (which at a minimum should include 

business correspondence material to CDD 

measures or significant changes to the 

operat ion of the account) ; and                                        

> 93 For SDD, please refer to paragraphs 4.8; for situations where special requirements are required,
> please refer to paragraphs 4.9 to 4.14; for additional due diligence measures and other
> requirements for cross-border correspondent relationships, please refer to paragraphs 4.20; for
> simplified and enhanced measures, please refer to paragraph 4.1.2.
> 94 This refers to a document which FIs may use to document the assessment of ML/TF risk levels
> associated with customers or business relationships. For example, the ML/TF risk rating of a
> customer (see paragraph 2.16), the assessment of ML/TF risk associated with the previous PEP
> status of the former non-Hong Kong PEPs, the former Hong Kong PEPs or the former
> international organisation PEPs (see paragraphs 4.11.19 and 4.11.25), etc.
> 95 An FI is not expected to keep each and every correspondence, such as a series of emails with
> the customer; the expectation is that sufficient correspondence is kept to demonstrate
> compliance with the AMLO. 120

(e) the results of any analysis undertaken (e.g. 

inquiries to establish the background and 

purposes of transactions that are complex, 

unusually large in amount or of unusual pattern, 

and have no apparent economic or lawful 

purpose). 

> s.20(2), (3) &
> (3A),
> Sch. 2

8.4 All documents and records mentioned in paragraph 

8.3 should be kept throughout the continuance of 

the business relationship with the customer and for 

a period of at least five years after the end of the 

business relationship. Similarly, for occasional 

transaction equal to or exceeding the CDD 

thresholds (i.e. $8,000 for wire transfers and 

$120,000 for other types of transactions 96 ), an FI 

should keep all documents and records mentioned 

in paragraph 8.3 for a period of at least five years 

after the date of the occasional transaction.  

> s.20(1)(a),
> Sch. 2

8.5 FIs should maintain the original or a copy of the 

documents, and a record of the data and 

information, obtained in connection with each 

transaction the FI carries out, both domestic and 

international, which should be sufficient to permit 

reconstruction of individual transactions so as to 

provide, if necessary, evidence for prosecution of 

criminal activity.  

> s.20(2),
> Sch. 2

8.6 All documents and records mentioned in paragraph 

8.5 should be kept for a period of at least five years 

after the completion of a transaction, regardless of 

whether the business relationship ends during the 

period.  

> s.21,
> Sch. 2

8.7 If the record consis ts of a document, either the 

original of the document should be retained or a 

copy of the document should be kept on microfilm 

or in the database of a computer. If the record 

consists of data or information, such record should   

> 96 For the avoidance of doubt, FIs that are LCs or SFC-licensed VAS Providers should not carry
> out occasional transactions. FIs should also refer to the guidance provided in paragraph 12.9.1
> for occasional transaction that is a virtual asset transfer. 121

be kept either on microfilm or in the database of a 

computer.  

> s.20(4),
> Sch. 2

8.8 An RA may, by notice in writing to an FI, require it to 

keep the records relating to a specified transaction 

or customer for a period specified by the RA that is 

longer than those referred to in paragraphs 8.4 and 

8.6, where the records are relevant to an ongoing 

criminal or other investigation carried out by the RA, 

or to any other purposes as specified in the notice.  

> Part 3,
> Sch. 2

8.9 Irrespective of where CDD and transaction records 

are held, an FI is required to comply with all legal 

and regulatory requirements in Hong Kong, 

especially Part 3 of Schedule 2. 

## Records kept by intermediaries  

> s.18(4)(b),
> Sch. 2

8.10 Where customer identification and verification 

documents are held by an intermediary on which the 

FI is relying to carry out CDD measures, an FI 

concerned remains responsible for compliance with 

all record-keeping requirements. The FI should 

ensure that the intermediary being relied on has 

systems in place to comply with all the record-

keeping requirements under the AMLO and this 

Guideline (including the requirements of paragraphs 

8.3 to 8.9), and that documents and records will be 

provided by the intermediary as soon as reasonably 

practicable after the intermediary receives the 

request from the FI.  

> s.18(4)(a),
> Sch. 2

8.11 For the avoidance of doubt, an FI that rel ies on an 

intermediary for carrying out a CDD measure should 

immediately obtain the data or information that the 

intermediary has obtained in the course of carrying 

out that measure. 

8.12 An FI should ensure that an intermediary will pass 

the documents and records to the FI, upon 

termination of the services provided by the 

intermediary. 122 

# Chapter 9 – STAFF TRAINING 

9.1 Ongoing staff training is an important element of an 

effective system to prevent and detect ML/TF 

activities. The effective implementation of even a 

well-designed internal control system can be 

compromised if staff using the system is not 

adequately trained. 

9.2 It is an FI’s responsibility to provide adequate 

training for its staff so that they are adequately 

trained to implement its AML/CFT Systems. The 

scope and frequency of training should be tailored to 

the specific risks faced by the FI and pitched 

according to the job functions, responsibilities and 

experience of the staff. New staff should be required 

to attend initial training as soon as possible after 

being hired or appointed. 

Apart from the initial training, an FI should also 

provide refresher training regularly to ensure that its 

staff are reminded of their responsibilities and are 

kept informed of new developments related to 

ML/TF. 

9.3 An FI should implement a clear and well articulated 

policy for ensuring that relevant staff receive 

adequate AML/CFT training. 

9.4 Staff should be made aware of: 

(a) their FI’s and their own personal statutory 

obligations and the possible consequences for 

failure to comply with CDD and record-keeping 

requirements under the AMLO; 

(b) their FI’s and their own personal statutory 

obligations and the possible consequences for 

failure to report suspicious transactions under 

the DTROP, the OSCO and the UNATMO; 

(c) any other statutory and regulatory obligations 

that concern their FIs and themselves under the 123 

DTROP, the OSCO, the UNATMO, the UNSO ,

the WMD(CPS)O and the AMLO, and the 

possible consequences of breaches of these 

obligations; 

(d) the FI’s policies and procedures relating to 

AML/CFT, including suspicious transaction 

identification and reporting; and 

(e) any new and emerging techniques, methods and 

trends in ML/TF to the extent that such 

information is needed by the staff to carry out 

their particular roles in the FI with respect to 

AML/CFT. 

9.5 In addition, the following areas of training may be 

appropriate for certain groups of staff: 

(a) all new staff, irrespective of seniority: 

(i) an introduction to the background to ML/TF 

and the importance placed on ML/TF by the 

FI; and 

(ii) the need for identifying and reporting of any 

suspicious transactions to the MLRO, and 

the offence of tipping-off; 

(b) front-line personnel who are dealing directly with 

the public: 

(i) the importance of their roles in the FI’s 

ML/TF strategy, as the first point of contact 

with potential money launderers; 

(ii) the FI’s policies and procedures in relation to 

CDD and record-keeping requirements that 

are relevant to their job responsibilities; and 

(iii) training in circumstances that may give rise 

to suspicion, and relevant policies and 

procedures, including, for example, lines of 

reporting and when extra vigilance might be 

required; 

(c) back-office staff, depending on their roles: 

(i) appropriate training on customer verification 

and relevant processing procedures; and 

(ii) how to recognise unusual activities including 

abnormal settlements, payments or delivery 

instructions; 124 

(d) managerial staff including internal audit officers 

and COs: 

(i) higher level training covering all aspects of 

the FI’s AML/CFT regime; and 

(ii) specific training in relation to their 

responsibilities for supervising or managing 

staff, auditing the system and performing 

random checks as well as reporting of 

suspicious transactions to the JFIU; and 

(e) MLROs: 

(i) specific training in relation to their 

responsibilities for assessing suspicious 

transaction reports submitted to them and 

reporting of suspicious transactions to the 

JFIU; and 

(ii) training to keep abreast of AML/CFT 

requirements/developments generally. 

9.6 An FI is encouraged to consider using a mix of 

training techniques and tools in delivering training, 

depending on the available resources and learning 

needs of their staff. These techniques and tools 

may include on-line learning systems, focused 

classroom training, relevant videos as well as paper-

or intranet-based procedures manuals. An FI may 

consider including available FATF papers and 

typologies as part of the training materials. The FI 

should be able to demonstrate to the RA that all 

materials should be up-to-date and in line with 

current requirements and standards. 

9.7 No matter which training approach is adopted, an FI 

should maintain records of who have been trained, 

when the staff received the training and the type of 

the training provided. Records should be maintained 

for a minimum of 3 years. 

9.8 An FI should monitor the effectiveness of the 

training. This may be achieved by: 

(a) testing staff’s understanding of the FI’s policies 

and procedures to combat ML/TF, the 125 

understanding of their statutory and regulatory 

obligations, and also their ability to recognise 

suspicious transactions; 

(b) monitoring the compliance of staff with the FI’s 

AML/CFT Systems as well as the quality and 

quantity of internal reports so that further training 

needs may be identified and appropriate action 

can be taken; and 

(c) monitoring attendance and following up with staff 

who miss such training without reasonable 

cause. 126 

# Chapter 10 – WIRE TRANSFERS 

## General 

10.1 This Chapter primarily applies to authorized 

institutions and money service operators. Other FIs 

should also comply with section 12 of Schedule 2 

and the guidance provided in this Chapter if they act 

as an ordering institution, an intermediary institution 

or a beneficiary institution as defined under the 

AMLO. Where an FI is the originator or recipient of 

a wire transfer, it is not acting as an ordering 

institution, an intermediary institution or a beneficiary 

institution and thus is not required to comply with the 

requirements under section 12 of Schedule 2 or this 

Chapter in respect of that transaction. 

> s.1(4) &
> s.12(11),
> Sch. 2

10.2 A wire transfer is a transaction carried out by an 

institution (the ordering institution) on behalf of a 

person (the originator) by electronic means with a 

view to making an amount of money available to that 

person or another person (the recipient) at an 

institution (the beneficiary institution), which may be 

the ordering institution 97 or another institution, 

whether or not one or more other institutions 

(intermediary institutions) participate in completion 

of the transfer of the money. An FI should follow the 

relevant requirements set out in this Chapter with 

regard to its role in a wire transfer. 

10.3 The requirements set out in section 12 of Schedule 

2 and this Chapter are also applicable to wire 

transfers using cover payment mechanism (e.g. 

MT202COV payments) 98 . 

> s.12(2),
> Sch. 2

10.4 Section 12 of Schedule 2 and this Chapter do not 

apply to the following wire transfers:   

> 97 For example, a wire transfer conducted between branches of the same FI.
> 98 Reference should be made to the paper “Due diligence and transparency regarding cover
> payment messages related to cross-border wire transfer” published by the Basel Committee on
> Banking Supervision in May 2009 and the “Guidance Paper on Cover Payment Messages
> Related to Cross-border Wire Transfers” issued by the HKMA in February 2010. 127

(a) a wire transfer between two FIs as defined in the 

AMLO if each of them acts on its own behalf; 

(b) a wire transfer between an FI as defined in the 

AMLO and a foreign institution 99 if each of them 

acts on its own behalf; 

(c) a wire transfer if: 

(i) it arises from a transaction that is carried out 

using a credit card, debit card or prepaid card 

(such as withdrawing money from a bank 

account through an automated teller machine 

with a debit card, obtaining a cash advance 

on a credit card, or paying for goods or 

services with a credit card, debit card or 

prepaid card); 

(ii) the card is not used as a payment system to 

effect a person-to-person transfer; and 

(iii) the number (or equivalent unique identifier) 

of the credit card, debit card or prepaid card 

is included in the message or payment form 

accompanying the transfer. 

## Ordering institutions  

> s.12(3) & (5),
> Sch. 2

10.5 An ordering institution must ensure that a wire 

transfer of amount equal to or above $8,000 (or an 

equivalent amount in any other currency) is 

accompanied by the following originator and 

recipient information: 

(a) the originator’s name; 

(b) the number of the originator’s account 

maintained with the ordering institution and from 

which the money for the wire transfer is paid or, 

in the absence of such an account, a unique 

reference number assigned by the ordering 

institution;  

> 99 For the purposes of section 12 of Schedule 2 and this Chapter, “foreign institution” means an
> institution that is located in a place outside Hong Kong and that carries on a business similar to
> that carried on by an FI as defined in the AMLO. 128

(c) the originator’s address or, the originator’ s 

customer identification number 100 or 

identification document number or, if the 

originator is an individual, the originator’s date 

and place of birth; 

(d) the recipient’s name; and 

(e) the number of the recipient’s account maintained 

with the beneficiary institution and to which the 

money for the wire transfer is paid or, in the 

absence of such an account, a unique reference 

number assigned to the wire transfer by the 

beneficiary institution.  

> s.12(3), (3A)
> & (5), Sch. 2

10.6 An ordering institution must ensure that a wire 

transfer of amount below $8,000 (or an equivalent 

amount in any other currency) is accompanied by 

the following originator and recipient information: 

(a) the originator’s name; 

(b) the number of the originator’s account 

maintained with the ordering institution and from 

which the money for the wire transfer is paid or, 

in the absence of such an account, a unique 

reference number assigned by the ordering 

institution; 

(c) the recipient’s name; and 

(d) the number of the recipient’s account maintained 

with the beneficiary institution and to which the 

money for the wire transfer is paid or, in the 

absence of such an account, a unique reference 

number assigned to the wire transfer by the 

beneficiary institution. 

10.7 The unique reference number assigned by the 

ordering institution or beneficiary institution referred 

to in paragraphs 10.5 and 10.6 should permit 

traceability of the wire transfer.  

> 100 Customer identification number refers to a number which uniquely identifies the originator to the
> originating institution and is a different number from the unique transaction reference number
> referred to in paragraph 10.7. The customer identification number must refer to a record held by
> the originating institution which contains at least one of the following: the customer address, the
> identification document number, or the date and place of birth. 129

10.8 For a wire transfer of amount equal to or above 

$8,000 (or an equivalent amount in any other 

currency), an ordering institution must ensure that 

the required originator information accompanying 

the wire transfer is accurate. 

> s.3(1)(d) &
> (1A),
> Sch. 2

10.9 For an occasional wire transfer involving an amount 

equal to or above $8,000 (or an equivalent amount 

in any other currency), an ordering institution must 

verify the identity of the originator. For an 

occasional wire transfer below $8,000 (or an 

equivalent amount in any other currency), the 

ordering institution is in general not required to verify 

the originator’s identity, except when several 

transactions are carried out which appear to the 

ordering institution to be linked and are equal to or 

above $8,000 (or an equivalent amount in any other 

currency), or when there is a suspicion of ML/TF.  

> s.12(7),
> Sch. 2

10.10 An ordering institution may bundle a number of wire 

transfers from a single originator into a batch file for 

transmission to a recipient or recipients in a place 

outside Hong Kong. In such cases, the ordering 

institution may only include the originator’s account 

number or, in the absence of such an account, a 

unique reference number in the wire transfer but the 

batch file should contain required and accurate 

originator information, and required recipient 

information, that is fully traceable within the recipient 

country.  

> s.12(6),
> Sch. 2

10.11 For a domestic wire transfer 101 , an ordering 

institution may choose not to include the complete 

required originator information in the wire transfer 

but only include the originator’s account number or, 

in the absence of an account, a unique reference 

number, provided that the number permits               

> 101 Domestic wire transfer means a wire transfer in which the ordering institution and the beneficiary

traceability of the wire transfer.  

> s.12(6),
> Sch. 2

10.12 If an ordering institution chooses not to include 

complete required originator information as stated in 

paragraph 10.11, it must, on the request of the 

institution to which it passes on the transfer 

instruction or the RA, provide complete required 

originator information within 3 business days after 

the request is received. In addition, such 

information should be made available to law 

enforcement agencies immediately upon request.  

> s.19(2),
> Sch. 2

10.13 An ordering institution should establish and maintain 

effective procedures to ensure that proper 

safeguards exist to prevent carrying out outgoing 

wire transfers that do not comply with the relevant 

originator or recipient information requirements, 

which include: 

(a) taking reasonable measures (e.g. regular review 

or testing by internal control or audit function to 

assess system capabilities) to identify whether 

domestic or cross-border wire transfers lack 

required originator information or required 

recipient information; and 

(b) having risk-based policies and procedures for 

handling wire transfers lacking required 

originator information or required recipient 

information, and timely rectifying any control 

deficiencies identified. 

## Intermediary institutions  

> s.12(8),
> Sch. 2

10.14 An intermediary institution must ensure that all 

originator and recipient information which 

accompanies the wire transfer is retained with the 

transfer and is transmitted to the institution to which 

it passes on the transfer instruction. 

10.15 Where technical limitations prevent the required 

originator or recipient information accompanying a 

cross -border wire transfer from remaining with a131 

related domestic wire transfer, the intermediary 

institution should keep a record, for at least five 

years, of all the information received from the 

ordering institution or another intermediary 

institution. The above requirement also applies to a 

situation where technical limitations prevent the 

required originator or recipient information 

accompanying a domestic wire transfer from 

remaining with a related cross-border wire transfer.  

> s.19(2),
> Sch. 2

10.16 An intermediary institution must establish and 

maintain effective procedures for identifying and 

handling incoming wire transfers that do not comply 

with the relevant originator or recipient information 

requirements, which include: 

(a) taking reasonable measures, which are 

consistent with straight-through processing, to 

identify cross-border wire transfers that lack 

required originator information or required 

recipient information; and 

(b) having risk-based policies and procedures for 

determining: (i) when to execute, reject, or 

suspend a wire transfer lacking required 

originator information or required recipient 

information; and (ii) the appropriate follow-up 

action.  

> s.12(10)(a),
> Sch. 2

10.17 In respect of the risk-based policies and procedures 

referred to in paragraph 10.16, if a cross-border wire 

transfer is not accompanied by the required 

originator information or required recipient 

information, the intermediary institution must as 

soon as reasonably practicable, obtain the missing 

information from the institution from which it receives 

the transfer instruction. If the missing information 

cannot be obtained, the intermediary institution 

should either consider restricting or terminating its 

business relationship with that institution, or take 

reasonable measures to mitigate the risk of ML/TF 

involved. 132  

> s.12(10)(b),
> Sch. 2

10.18 If the intermediary institution is aware that the 

accompanying information that purports to be the 

required originator information or required recipient 

information is incomplete or meaningless, it must as 

soon as reasonably practicable take reasonable 

measures to mitigate the risk of ML/TF involved. 

## Beneficiary institutions  

> s.19(2),
> Sch. 2

10.19 A beneficiary institution must establish and maintain 

effective procedures for identifying and handling 

incoming wire transfers that do not comply with the 

relevant originator or recipient information 

requirements, which include: 

(a) taking reasonable measures (e.g. post-event 

monitoring) to identify domestic or cross-border 

wire transfers that lack required originator 

information or required recipient information; and 

(b) having risk-based policies and procedures for 

determining: (i) when to execute, reject, or 

suspend a wire transfer lacking required 

originator information or required recipient 

information; and (ii) the appropriate follow-up 

action.

10.20 In respect of the risk-based policies and procedures 

referred to in paragraph 10.19, if a domestic or 

cross-border wire transfer is not accompanied by the 

required originator information or required recipient 

information, the beneficiary institution must as soon 

as reasonably practicable, obtain the missing 

information from the institution from which it receives 

the transfer instruction. If the missing information 

cannot be obtained, the beneficiary institution should 

either consider restricting or terminating its business 

relationship with that institution, or take reasonable 

measures to mitigate the risk of ML/TF involved. 

> s.12(9)(b) &
> s.12(10)(b),

10.21 If the beneficiary institution is aware that the 

accompanying information that purports to be the 

required originator information or required recipient 133 

information is incomplete or meaningless, it must as 

soon as reasonably practicable take reasonable 

measures to mitigate the risk of ML/TF involved.  

> s.3(1) & (1A),
> Sch. 2

10.22 For a wire transfer of amount equal to or above 

$8,000 (or an equivalent amount in any other 

currency), a beneficiary institution should verify the 

identity of the recipient, if the identity has not been 

previously verified. 134 

# Chapter 11 – THIRD-PARTY DEPOSITS AND 

# PAYMENTS 

## General 

11.1 When a customer uses a third party 102 to pay for or 

receive the proceeds of investment, there is a risk 

that the arrangement may be used to disguise the 

true beneficial owner or the source of funds. There 

are increased risks that these investment 

transactions are linked to predicate offences in 

securities markets (such as insider dealing and 

market manipulation) or used to launder illicit 

proceeds obtained elsewhere.  

> s.23(b),
> Sch. 2

11.2 An FI must take all reasonable measures to mitigate 

the ML/TF risks associated with transactions 

involving third-party deposits and payments, having 

regard to the provisions in this Guideline as well as 

relevant circulars and frequently asked questions 

published by the SFC from time to time. 

## Policies and procedures 

11.3 Third-party deposits or payments should be 

accepted only under exceptional and legitimate 

circumstances and when they are reasonably in line 

with the customer’s profile and normal commercial 

practices. 

Before an FI accepts any third-party deposit or 

payment arrangement, it should ensure that 

adequate policies and procedures are put in place to 

mitigate the inherently high risk and meet all 

applicable legal and regulatory requirements. 

These policies and procedures should be approved 

by senior management and address, among others:  

> 102 For the purposes of Chapter 11, “third party” means any person other than the customer.

135 

(a) the exceptional and legitimate circumstances 

under which third-party deposits or payments 103 

may be accepted and their evaluation criteria; 

(b) the monitoring systems and controls for 

identifying transactions involving third-party 

deposits in the form of funds (i.e. fiat 

currency) 104 ;

(c) if applicable, the due diligence process for 

assessing whether third-party deposits or 

payments meet the evaluation criteria for 

acceptance; 

(d) if an FI allows the due diligence on the source of 

a deposit or the evaluation of a third-party 

deposit to be completed after settling 

transactions with the deposited funds (please 

refer to paragraphs 11.9 to 11.11) in exceptional 

situations, the identification of those exceptional 

situations and the risk management policies and 

procedures concerning the conditions under 

which such delayed due diligence or evaluation 

may be allowed 105 ;

(e) the enhanced monitoring of client accounts 

involving third-party deposits or payments 106 ,

and the reporting of any ML/TF suspicions 

identified to the JFIU; and 

(f) the respective designated managers or staff 

members responsible for carrying out these 

policies and procedures. 

An MIC of AML/CFT, MIC of Compliance or other 

appropriate senior management personnel should  

> 103

Given that the need for third-party payments should be rare and normal commercial practices 

may differ, circumstances which may be considered to be exceptional and legitimate for third-

party payments may not be the same as or similar to those for third-party deposits.  

> 104

For example, an FI may require the client to confirm whether a cheque deposit made for the 

account of the client has originated from the bank account of client or a third party, and provide 

an image of the cheque showing the name of its drawer.  

> 105

For the avoidance of doubt, delayed due diligence on the source of a deposit or evaluation of a 

third-party deposit should be allowed only when there is no suspicion of ML/TF.  

> 106

The extent of enhanced monitoring should be commensurate with the ML/TF risks posed by the 

third parties. For example, closer monitoring should be applied to deposits from third parties 

who are not immediate family members (e.g. a spouse, parent or child), beneficial owners or 

affiliated companies of the clients, regulated custodians or lending institutions. 136 

be designated to oversee the proper design and 

implementation of these policies and procedures. 

11.4 To facilitate the prompt identification of the sources 

of deposits in the form of funds, FIs are strongly 

encouraged to require their clients to designate bank 

accounts held in their own names or the names of 

any acceptable third parties for the making of all 

deposits. This will make it easier for FIs to ascertain 

whether deposits have originated from their clients 

or any acceptable third parties 107 .

## Due diligence process for assessing third-party 

## deposits and payments 

11.5 Due diligence process for assessing third-party 

deposits and payments should include: 

(a) critically evaluating the reasons and the need for 

third-party deposits or payments; 

(b) taking reasonable measures on a risk-sensitive 

basis to: 

(i) verify the identities of the third parties; and 

(ii) ascertain the relationship between the third 

parties and the customers; 

(c) obtaining the approval of the MIC of AML/CFT, 

another member of senior management with a 

relevant role at the FI with respect to AML/CFT, 

or MLRO (hereafter referred to as “third-party 

deposit or payment approvers”) for the 

acceptance for a third-party deposit or payment; 

and 

(d) documenting the findings of inquiries made and 

corroborative evidence obtained during the due 

diligence process as well as the approval of a 

third-party deposit or payment.                            

> 107 Likewise, if applicable, the use of designated bank accounts held in the names of any
> acceptable third parties for the making of fund withdrawals will make it easier for FIs to complete
> the necessary due diligence to determine the acceptability of athird-party payee before
> effecting a third-party fund payment. 137

11.6 While a standing approval may be given by third-

party deposit or payment approvers for accepting 

deposits or payments from or to a particular third 

party after assessing the risks and reasonableness 

of the third-party arrangement, the standing 

approval should be subject to review periodically or 

upon trigger events to ensure that it remains 

appropriate. 

11.7 Given that not all third-party payors and payees 

pose the same level of ML/TF risk 108 , an FI should 

apply enhanced scrutiny to those third parties which 

might pose higher risks, and require the dual 

approval of deposits or payments from or to such 

third parties by the third-party deposit or payment 

approvers for enhanced control. 

11.8 An FI should exercise extra caution when the 

relationship between the customer and the third 

party is hard to verify, the customer is unable to 

provide details of the identity of the third-party payor 

for verification before the deposit is made, or one 

third party is making or receiving payments for or 

from several seemingly unrelated customers. 

## Delayed due diligence on the source of a deposit or 

## evaluation of a third-party deposit in the form of funds 

11.9 An FI should perform due diligence on the source of 

a deposit and evaluation of any third-party deposit 

(hereafter referred to as “third-party deposit due 

diligence”) before settling transactions with the 

deposited funds. However, FIs may, in exceptional 

situations, complete the third-party deposit due 

diligence after settling transactions with the 

deposited funds, provided that: 

(a) any risk of ML/TF arising from the delay in   

> 108 Examples of third parties that are generally considered to pose relatively low risks include
> immediate family members (e.g. a spouse, parent or child), beneficial owners or affiliated
> companies of the customers, or regulated custodians or lending institutions. Other third parties
> might pose higher risks.

138 

completing the third-party deposit due diligence 

can be effectively managed; 

(b) it is necessary to avoid interruption of the normal 

conduct of business with the customer 109 ; and 

(c) the third-party deposit due diligence is 

completed as soon as possible after settling 

transactions with the deposited funds. 

11.10 If an FI allows third-party deposit due diligence to be 

delayed in exceptional situations, it should adopt 

appropriate risk management policies and 

procedures setting out the conditions under which 

the customer may utilise the deposited funds prior to 

the completion of the third-party deposit due 

diligence. These policies and procedures should 

include: 

(a) establishing a reasonable timeframe 110 for the 

completion of the third-party deposit due 

diligence, and the follow-up actions if the 

stipulated timeframe is exceeded (e.g. to 

suspend or terminate the business relationship); 

(b) placing appropriate limits on the number, types, 

and/or amount of transactions that can be 

performed 111 ;

(c) performing enhanced monitoring of transactions 

carried out by or for the customer; and 

(d) ensuring senior management is periodically 

informed of all cases involving delay in 

completing third -party deposit due diligence.  

> 109

An example of a situation where it may be necessary not to interrupt the normal conduct of 

business is when FIs are required to meet settlement obligations on behalf of its customers (e.g. 

to meet a margin call deadline) using funds the customer has deposited shortly before.  

> 110

In determining the reasonable timeframe for completing third-party deposit due diligence, an FI 

should take into account the ML/TF risks associated with the business relationship with a 

customer, e.g. a stricter timeframe is imposed on deposits for high risk customers.  

> 111

For example, prior to the completion of third-party deposit due diligence on the deposited funds, 

an FI may restrict a customer from withdrawing the subsequent sales proceeds arising from the 

disposal of investments purchased with the deposited funds (except to return funds to the 

payment source). In this regard, the FI should ensure that a standing authority or written 

direction is obtained from the client to return the funds to the third party’s payment source (see 

sections 4 to 8 of the Securities and Futures (Client Money) Rules). 139 

11.11 If the third-party deposit due diligence cannot be 

completed within the reasonable timeframe set out 

in the FI’s risk management policies and 

procedures, the FI should refrain from carrying out 

further transactions for the customer. The FI should 

assess whether there are grounds for knowledge or 

suspicion of ML/TF and filing an STR to the JFIU, 

particularly where the customer refuses without 

reasonable explanation to provide information or 

document requested by the FI, or otherwise refuses 

to cooperate with the third-party deposit due 

diligence process. 140 

# Chapter 12 – VIRTUAL ASSETS 

## 12.1 Introduction 

12.1.1 This Chapter provides guidance on the ML/TF risks 

in relation to virtual assets and the AML/CFT 

regulatory requirements and standards for 

addressing such risks. These include factors that 

should be taken into consideration when 

conducting risk assessments under an RBA, virtual 

asset-specific requirements in conducting CDD 

and ongoing monitoring, and requirements in 

relation to virtual asset transfers and third-party 

deposits and payments in the form of virtual 

assets. 

It also provides elaborations and explanations of 

existing requirements in this Guideline with respect 

to their application to virtual asset transactions and 

activities, and sets out non-exhaustive illustrative 

risk indicators for assessing ML/TF risks and 

indicators of suspicious transactions and activities 

in relation to virtual assets. 

12.1.2 This Chapter is applicable to FIs that are SFC-

licensed VAS Providers, and LCs when carrying 

out businesses associated with virtual assets or 

businesses which give rise to ML/TF risks in 

relation to virtual assets 112 .

12.1.3 For the purposes of this Chapter, the term “virtual 

assets” means (i) any “virtual asset” as defined in 

section 53ZRA of the AMLO; and (ii) any security 

token. The term “security token” means a

cryptographically secured digital representation of 

value which constitutes “securities” as defined in 

section 1 of Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the SFO.   

> 112 For example, when an LC offers products, services or transactions involving virtual assets, or
> when an LC’s customer derives its funds or wealth substantially from virtual assets or carries out
> virtual asset businesses. 141
> s.23(a) & (b),
> Sch. 2

12.1.4 An FI must take all reasonable measures to ensure 

that proper safeguards exist to prevent a

contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 

of Schedule 2 and to mitigate the ML/TF risks in 

relation to virtual assets, having regard to the 

guidance and requirements set out in this Chapter 

as well as (where applicable) relevant circulars and 

frequently asked questions published by the SFC 

from time to time. 

Potential uses of the virtual asset sector in the money laundering process 

12.1.5 Virtual asset transactions are, in general, 

pseudonymous or anonymity-enhanced by nature. 

Illicit actors or money launderers could take 

advantage of the borderless nature and near-

instantaneous transaction speed that virtual assets 

provide. In addition, virtual asset transactions 

could be exploited by illicit actors or money 

launderers as they can be conducted on peer-to-

peer basis without any involvement of 

intermediaries to carry out AML/CFT measures 

such as CDD and transaction monitoring. 

12.1.6 There are three common stages in the laundering 

of money, and they frequently involve numerous 

transactions. An FI should be alert to any such 

sign for potential criminal activities. These stages 

are: 

(a) Placement - the disposal of cash proceeds or 

disposal of virtual assets derived from illegal 

activities; 

(b) Layering - separating illicit proceeds from their 

source by creating complex layers of financial 

transactions, or utilising technologies (e.g. 

anonymity-enhancing technologies or 

mechanisms), designed to disguise the source 

of the funds or virtual assets, subvert the audit 

trail and provide anonymity; and 

(c) Integration - creating the impression of 

apparent legitimacy to criminally derived 

wealth. In situations where the layering 142 

process succeeds, integration schemes 

effectively return the laundered proceeds back 

into the general financial system and the 

proceeds appear to be the result of, or 

connected to, legitimate business activities. 

12.1.7 Transactions facilitated by virtual asset businesses 

may be cash based, and hence may be used as 

the initial placement of criminally derived cash 

proceeds. Further, virtual asset businesses may 

be used as the placement facility for disposing or 

depositing virtual assets derived from illicit 

activities or linked to predicate offences (such as 

online scams, ransomware and other cybercrimes). 

12.1.8 Virtual asset businesses are also likely to be used 

at the second stage of money laundering, i.e. the 

layering process. These businesses provide a

potential avenue which enables the illicit actors or 

money launderers to dramatically alter the form of 

funds (i.e. fiat currency) or virtual assets. This not 

only allows conversion from cash in hand or other 

funds to virtual assets as well as conversion from 

one type of virtual asset to another, it also allows 

conversion from virtual assets derived from illicit 

activities or associated with illicit sources to cash in 

hand or other funds after conducting transactions 

for no other purposes but to further obfuscate the 

fund flows and the identity of the holder or 

beneficial owner of the virtual assets. 

To obfuscate the sources of virtual assets derived 

from illicit activities, illicit actors or money 

launderers may move assets across multiple wallet 

addresses, service providers, types of virtual 

assets or blockchains. They may exploit virtual 

asset-specific layering techniques such as peel 

chains 113 and chain-hopping 114 .  

> 113 Peel chains mean moving a large amount of virtual assets through a series of transactions in
> which a slightly smaller amount of virtual assets is transferred to a new address each time.
> 114 Chain-hopping means moving virtual assets on a blockchain to another blockchain, often in
> rapid succession and with the aim of evading attempts to track these movements.

143 

Virtual assets are sometimes laundered through 

anonymity-enhancing services such as mixers or 

tumblers 115 and the use of other anonymity-

enhancing technologies or mechanisms (e.g. 

anonymity-enhanced virtual asset or privacy coin, 

privacy wallet, etc.). 

12.1.9 Unhosted wallets 116 , decentralised virtual asset 

exchanges, peer-to-peer platforms or virtual asset 

businesses that are unregulated or with lax 

AML/CFT controls are particularly attractive to illicit 

actors or money launderers. 

12.1.10 The combination of the ability to readily convert 

virtual assets procured with both licit and illicit 

proceeds, the ability to conceal the source of the 

illicit proceeds, the availability of a vast array of 

virtual assets, and the ease and near-

instantaneous transaction speed with which virtual 

asset transactions can be effected, offers illicit 

actors or money launderers attractive ways to 

effectively integrate criminal proceeds into the 

general economy. 

12.1.11 In addition to the examples of money laundering 

methods and characteristics of financial 

transactions that have been linked with terrorist 

financing provided in paragraph 1.19, the chart set 

out below illustrates the money laundering process 

relevant to the virtual asset sector in detail.   

> 115 Mixers or tumblers are services which mix virtual assets from different users and subsequently
> return the assets to a new wallet address designated by the users, with an aim to break the
> connection between a sending and receiving address and obscure the trail to the original source
> while simultaneously improving the anonymity of transactions.
> 116 An unhosted wallet refers to software or hardware that enables a person to store and transfer
> virtual assets on his own behalf, and in relation to which the private key is controlled or held by
> that person. 144

## 12.2 RBA - Institutional risk assessment and customer 

## risk assessment 

Considering relevant risk factors 

12.2.1 In addition to the factors set out in paragraph 2.7 

which an FI should holistically consider in 

determining the level of overall risk that the FI is 

exposed to, an FI should consider: 

(a) in relation to country risk, the regulatory and 

supervisory regime and controls of the 

jurisdictions in which the FI is operating or 

otherwise exposed to – for example, the 

regulatory treatment of virtual assets in the 

jurisdiction; and the AML/CFT laws and 

regulations of the jurisdiction, including (where 

applicable) those in relation to virtual asset 

service providers (VASPs) (referred to in 

paragraph 12.6.1); and 

(b) in relation to product/service/transaction risk: 

(i) the characteristics of the products and 

services that it offers and transactions it 

executes, and the extent to which these 

are vulnerable to ML/TF abuse, for 

example, 145 

(A) the market capitalisation, value and 

price volatility, trading volume or 

liquidity, and (where applicable) market 

share of a virtual asset that it offers; 

(B) whether a product is or a service 

involves an anonymity-enhanced virtual 

asset or other virtual asset that has 

characteristics that promote anonymity, 

obfuscate the trail of transactions or 

impede the FI in identifying the 

counterparties of the transactions; 

(C) whether the virtual asset transactions 

are effected under an open (e.g. public 

blockchain) or closed-loop system (e.g. 

private blockchain); and 

(D) (where applicable) the reputation and 

AML/CFT controls of the issuer and/or 

the central entity governing the 

arrangement in relation to the virtual 

asset; and 

(ii) the proportion of virtual asset transactions 

conducted for its customers that are 

identified as being associated with illicit or 

suspicious activities/sources 117 .

12.2.2 Pursuant to paragraph 2.8, in identifying and 

assessing the ML/TF risks that may arise in 

relation to the development of new products and 

new business practices and the use of new or 

developing technologies for both new and pre-

existing products, an FI should also identify and 

assess the ML/TF risks that may arise from 

conducting virtual asset transactions involving the 

use of anonymity-enhancing technologies or 

mechanisms, including but not limited to 

anonymity-enhanced virtual assets, mixers, 

tumblers, privacy wallets and other technologies 

that obfuscate the identity of the originator, 

recipient, holder or beneficial owner of a virtual 

asset.  

> 117 Examples of illicit or suspicious activities/sources are provided in paragraph 12.7.3. 146

In taking appropriate measures to mitigate and 

manage the risks identified, the FI should refrain 

from conducting such virtual asset transactions if 

the identified risks cannot be mitigated and 

managed. 

Conducting risk assessment 

12.2.3 When conducting institutional risk assessment and 

customer risk assessment, in addition to the list of 

illustrative risk indicators set out in Appendix A, an 

FI should also refer to paragraphs 12.15 for the list 

of non-exhaustive illustrative risk indicators in 

relation to virtual assets, which may help identify a 

higher or lower level of risk associated with the risk 

factors stated in paragraphs 2.6 and 2.17 and 

should be taken into account holistically whenever 

relevant. 

## 12.3 CDD – What CDD measures are and when they 

## must be carried out 

When CDD measures must be carried out  

> s.3(1A),
> Sch.2

12.3.1 In addition to the circumstances set out in 

paragraph 4.1.9 pursuant to which an FI must carry 

out CDD measures in relation to a customer, an FI 

must carry out CDD measures in relation to a

customer before carrying out for the customer an 

occasional transaction that is a virtual asset 

transfer involving virtual assets that amount to no 

less than $8,000, whether the transaction is carried 

out in a single operation or in several operations 

that appear to the FI to be linked. 

12.3.2 In the context of virtual assets , “occasional 

transactions” 118 may also include, for example, 

virtual asset transfers and virtual asset 

conversions.  

> 118 It should be noted that FIs that are LCs or SFC-licensed VAS Providers should not carry out
> “occasional transactions”. 147

12.3.3 The criterion in paragraph 4.1.9(c) also applies 

irrespective of the $8,000 threshold applicable to 

occasional transactions set out in paragraph 

12.3.1. 

12.3.4 An FI should be vigilant to the possibility that a 

series of linked occasional transactions could meet 

or exceed the CDD threshold of $8,000 for 

occasional transactions set out in paragraph 

12.3.1. Where FIs become aware that this 

threshold is met or exceeded, CDD measures must 

be carried out. 

12.3.5 The factors linking occasional transactions are 

inherent in the characteristics of the transactions – 

for example, where several payments are made to 

the same recipient from one or more sources over 

a short period, where a customer regularly 

transfers funds or virtual assets to one or more 

destinations. In determining whether the 

transactions are in fact linked, FIs should consider 

these factors against the timeframe within which 

the transactions are conducted. 

## 12.4 CDD – Identification and verification of the 

## customer’s identity 

Other considerations 

12.4.1 In addition to the identification information in 

paragraphs 4.2.2, 4.2.5 and 4.2.10, (where 

applicable) an FI should obtain additional customer 

information that enables it to identify, manage and 

mitigate the ML/TF risks associated with the 

channels 119 through which the FI establishes 

business relationship with its customers and/or 

through which its customers conduct virtual asset 

transactions. Such additional customer information 

could include:  

> 119 For example, virtual asset transactions are typically conducted by customers of an FI through
> non-face-to-face channels (e.g. web-based platforms and mobile applications). 148

(a) IP address(es) with an associated time stamp; 

(b) geo-location data; and 

(c) device identifier(s). 

## 12. 5 CDD – Pre -existing customers 

12.5.1 For SFC-licensed VAS Providers that were not 

licensed by the SFC under the SFO before 1 June 

2023, the reference to “the AMLO came into effect 

on 1 April 2012” in paragraph 4.16.1 should be 

read as “1 June 2023”. 

## 12. 6 CDD – Cross -border correspondent relationships 

Introduction 

12.6.1 In the context of virtual assets, “cross-border 

correspondent relationships” set out in paragraph 

4.20.1 also refers to, for the purposes of this 

Guideline, the provision of services by an FI in the 

course of providing a VA service as defined in 

section 53ZR of the AMLO (hereafter referred to as 

“correspondent institution”) to a VASP 120 or 

financial institution 121 located in a place outside 

Hong Kong (hereafter referred to as “respondent 

institution”), where transactions effected on a

principal or agency basis under the business 

relationships are initiated by the respondent 

institution. 

12.6.2 An example of a cross-border correspondent 

relationship in the context of virtual assets is where 

an FI located in Hong Kong, as a correspondent 

institution, executes virtual asset trading 

transactions for a VASP or a financial institution 

operating outside Hong Kong, which acts as a

respondent institution for its underlying local 

customers.              

> 120 For the purposes of this Guideline, VASP refers to businesses falling within the definition of the
> term “virtual asset service providers” under the FATF Recommendations and which are
> conducted for or on behalf of customers.
> 121 For the purposes of this Chapter, financial institution refers to businesses falling within the
> definition of the term “financial institutions” under the FATF Recommendations and which are
> conducted for or on behalf of customers. 149

Additional due diligence measures for cross-border correspondent 

relationships 

12.6.3 In determining on a risk-sensitive basis pursuant to 

paragraph 4.20.7 the amount of information to 

collect about a respondent institution to enable it to 

understand the nature of the respondent 

institution’s business, an FI should understand 

whether the respondent institution engages in 

activities or transactions involving virtual assets 

that provide higher anonymity such as anonymity-

enhanced virtual assets; and the extent to which 

any of these activities or transactions are 

conducted for non-resident customers of the 

respondent institution. 

12.6.4 When assessing the AML/CFT controls of a

respondent institution pursuant to paragraph 

4.20.9, where the respondent institution handles 

virtual asset transactions, an FI should assess and 

ascertain whether the AML/CFT controls 

implemented by the respondent institution in 

relation to, among other things, virtual asset 

transfers, and screening of virtual asset 

transactions and the associated wallet addresses 

are adequate and effective. 

Ongoing monitoring 

12.6.5 In monitoring transactions of the respondent 

institution under paragraph 4.20.13(b), an FI 

should also take into account the requirements for 

ongoing monitoring of virtual asset transactions 

and the associated wallet addresses in paragraphs 

12.7.2 to 12.7.4 and 12.7.6. 

Cross-border correspondent relationships involving shell VASPs 

12.6.6 In addition to the prohibition to establish or 

continue a cross-border correspondent relationship 

with a shell financial institution under paragraph 

4.20.15, an FI must not establish or continue a 

cross-border correspondent relationship with a

shell VASP. 150 

The FI should also take appropriate measures to 

satisfy itself that its respondent institutions do not 

permit their correspondent accounts to be used by 

shell VASPs 122 .

12.6.7 For the purposes of this Guideline, a shell VASP is 

a corporation that: 

(a) is incorporated in a place outside Hong Kong; 

(b) is authorised to carry on virtual asset 

businesses 123 in that place; 

(c) does not have a physical presence in that 

place (see paragraph 4.20.17); and 

(d) is not an affiliate 124 of a regulated financial 

group that is subject to effective group-wide 

supervision. 

Other considerations 

12.6.8 Where an FI establishes similar business 

relationships with VASPs or financial institutions 

operating in Hong Kong (“correspondent 

relationships”) 125 , the FI will also be exposed to 

risks similar to cross-border correspondent 

relationships (i.e. lack or incompleteness of 

information about the underlying customers and 

transactions). In particular, the FI will be exposed 

to higher risks for correspondent relationships with 

VASPs that are not licensed or regulated but 

operating in Hong Kong.  

> 122

This includes a nested correspondent relationship under which the respondent institution uses 

the correspondent account to provide services to a shell VASP with which it has a business 

relationship.  

> 123

In this context, this refers to businesses falling within the definition of the term “virtual asset 

service providers” under the FATF Recommendations and which are conducted for or on behalf 

of customers.  

> 124

In this context, a corporation is an affiliate of another corporation if (a) the corporation is a 

subsidiary of the other corporation; or (b) at least one individual who is a controller of the 

corporation is at the same time a controller of the other corporation.  

> 125

This refers to where an FI provides services in the course of providing a VA service as defined 

in section 53ZR of the AMLO to VASPs or financial institutions operating in Hong Kong, where 

transactions effected on a principal or agency basis under the business relationships are 

initiated by the VASPs or financial institutions. 151 

Where applicable, the FI should adopt an RBA in 

applying the additional due diligence and other risk 

mitigating measures set out in paragraphs 4.20.5 

to 4.20.13 and 12.6.3 to 12.6.4 for the 

correspondent relationships with VASPs or 

financial institutions operating in Hong Kong. 

## 12.7 Ongoing monitoring in relation to virtual asset 

## transactions and activities 

12.7.1 Given the pseudonymous nature and transaction 

speed of virtual assets, illicit actors and designated 

parties may easily obfuscate the fund flows and 

further complicate the trail by utilising multiple 

wallets to conduct numerous or structured virtual 

asset transactions, thereby concealing the origin 

and destination of their virtual assets to avoid the 

detection of their ML/TF or other illicit activities. 

12.7.2 An FI 126 should therefore implement effective risk-

based transaction monitoring procedures to detect 

the origin and destination of the virtual assets 

transferred from or to its customers or other parties 

in relation to virtual asset transactions conducted 

for its customers 127 , particularly those from or to a 

VA transfer counterparty that presents a higher 

ML/TF risk (see paragraph 12.13.11) or an 

unhosted wallet (see paragraph 12.14.3), and to 

identify and report suspicious transactions as well 

as take appropriate follow-up actions. 

12.7.3 In this connection, the FI should establish and 

maintain adequate and effective systems and 

controls to conduct screening of virtual asset   

> 126 For the avoidance of doubt, paragraphs 12.7.2 to 12.7.4 and 12.7.6, Chapter 11 and paragraphs
> 12.10 are applicable to an FI that is an LC when it manages or distributes virtual asset funds
> that accept subscriptions or redemptions made by the fund investors in the form of virtual assets.
> Where such subscriptions or redemptions are handled by an appointed institution such as an
> administrator or a transfer agent, the LC should ensure that the appointed institution has
> appropriate measures in place to ensure compliance with the requirements similar to those
> imposed in paragraphs 12.7.2 to 12.7.4 and 12.7.6, Chapter 11 and paragraphs 12.10, so as to
> ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the associated ML/TF risks.
> 127 These include virtual asset transfers referred to in paragraphs 12.11.5 to 12.11.24 and 12.14.

152 

transactions and the associated wallet addresses. 

In particular, the FI should 128 :

(a) track the transaction history of virtual assets to 

more accurately identify the source and 

destination of these virtual assets; and 

(b) identify transactions involving wallet addresses 

that are directly and/or indirectly associated 

with illicit or suspicious activities/sources 129 , or 

designated parties. 

The FI should adopt appropriate technological 

solutions (e.g. blockchain analytic tools 130 ) that 

enable the tracking of virtual assets and the 

associated wallet addresses and identification of 

potentially suspicious transactions. 

12.7.4 Where an FI employs a technological solution 

provided by an external party to conduct screening 

of virtual asset transactions and the associated 

wallet addresses, the FI remains responsible for 

discharging its AML/CFT obligations. The FI 

should conduct due diligence on the solution 

before deploying it, taking into account relevant 

factors such as: 

(a) the quality and effectiveness of the tracking  

> 128

For the avoidance of doubt, the FI should conduct screening of virtual asset transactions and/or 

the associated wallet addresses before conducting a virtual asset transfer or making the 

transferred virtual assets available to the customer, and after conducting a virtual asset transfer 

on a risk-sensitive basis, so as to more timely and accurately identify the source and destination 

of these virtual assets and involvement or subsequent involvement of wallet addresses that are 

directly and/or indirectly associated with illicit or suspicious activities/sources, or designated 

parties.  

> 129

Illicit activities include, for example, ransomware, fraud, identity theft, phishing, and other 

cybercrimes; and suspicious activities/sources include, for example, darknet marketplaces, 

online gambling services, peel chains and use of anonymity-enhancing technologies or 

mechanisms (e.g. mixers, tumblers, privacy wallets). In addition, any wallet addresses owned 

or controlled by customer(s) with which the FI has decided not to establish or continue business 

relationships due to suspicion of ML/TF should be included as those associated with suspicious 

sources. Please refer to the meaning of peel chains and mixers and tumblers set out in 

paragraph 12.1.8.  

> 130

Blockchain analytic tools typically enable their users to trace the on-chain history of specific 

virtual assets. These tools support a number of common virtual assets and compare transaction 

histories against a database of wallet addresses connected to illicit or suspicious 

activities/sources, and flag identified transactions. 153 

and detection tools; 

(b) the coverage, accuracy and reliability of the 

information maintained in the database that 

supports its screening capability (e.g. whether 

the list of wallet addresses that are directly 

and/or indirectly associated with illicit or 

suspicious activities/sources, or designated 

parties, is subject to timely review and update); 

and 

(c) any limitations (e.g. limited reach of the 

blockchain analytical tools; or inability to deal 

with virtual assets or wallet addresses involving 

the use of anonymity-enhancing technologies 

or mechanisms such as anonymity-enhanced 

virtual assets, mixers or tumblers). 

12.7.5 An FI should (where applicable) monitor the 

additional customer information (i.e. IP addresses 

with associated time stamps, geo-location data, 

and device identifiers) referred to in paragraph 

12.4.1 obtained by the FI on an ongoing basis 131 to 

identify suspicious transactions and activities as 

well as take appropriate follow-up actions. 

12.7.6 The FI should also put in place policies and 

procedures to identify and analyse any additional 

red flags of suspicious transactions and activities in 

connection with the screening of virtual asset 

transactions and the associated wallet addresses 

as well as the ongoing monitoring of additional 

customer information, having regard to the list of 

illustrative indicators of suspicious transactions and 

activities set out in paragraphs 12.16 and Appendix 

B, which should prompt further investigations (see 

paragraph 7.12); and take appropriate steps such 

as making appropriate enquiries with customers to

> additional customer information on an ongoing basis.

154 

identify if there are any grounds for suspicion (see 

paragraphs 5.13 to 5.17) 132 .

Furthermore, where the FI becomes aware of any 

heightened ML/TF risks from the screening of 

virtual asset transactions and the associated wallet 

addresses or the ongoing monitoring of additional 

customer information, the FI should apply 

enhanced customer due diligence and ongoing 

monitoring, and take other additional preventive or 

mitigating actions as necessary to mitigate the 

ML/TF risks involved 133 .

## 12.8 Terrorist financing, financial sanctions and 

## proliferation financing – Database maintenance, 

## screening and enhanced checking 

12.8.1 In implementing an effective screening mechanism 

pursuant to paragraph 6.16, an FI’s screening 

mechanism should also include screening all 

relevant parties in a virtual asset transfer (referred 

to in paragraphs 12.11.5 to 12.11.24 and 12.14), 

including: 

(a) the recipient if the FI acts as the ordering 

institution or the virtual asset is transferred to 

an unhosted wallet; 

(b) the originator if the FI acts as the beneficiary 

institution or the virtual asset is transferred 

from an unhosted wallet; or 

(c) both the originator and recipient if the FI acts 

as the intermediary institution, 

against current database before executing the 

virtual asset transfer.   

> 132 When an FI evaluates a potentially suspicious transaction identified from the screening of virtual
> asset transactions and the associated wallet addresses, it may take into account the required
> originator and recipient information, as well as other customer information, transaction history,
> and any additional information that the FI obtained from the customer.
> 133 For example, where a customer enters the FI's platform from and/or initiates transactions with a
> masked IP address, the FI may request the customer to unmask the IP address and, where
> necessary, the FI may decline to provide services to that customer if the IP address remains
> masked.

155 

12.8.2 For the screening requirement set out in paragraph 

12.8.1, an FI should screen the required originator 

and recipient information 134 referred to in: 

(a) paragraph 12.11.5 or 12.11.6 in relation to a 

virtual asset transfer (including information 

which may be held separately to the virtual 

asset transfer itself); or 

(b) paragraph 12.14.2 in relation to a virtual asset 

transfer to or from an unhosted wallet. 

12.8.3 Where an incoming virtual asset transfer is 

conducted without the said screening or when any 

of the required originator and recipient information 

in relation to an incoming virtual asset transfer is 

missing (which renders the FI unable to conduct 

screening), the FI should take appropriate risk 

mitigating measures, having regard to its business 

practices 135 .

The risk mitigating measures taken by the FI 

should be documented.

12.9.1 In addition to the documents and records required 

to be kept and the period of time such documents 

and records are required to be kept pursuant to 

paragraphs 8.3 and 8.4, for an occasional 

transaction that is a virtual asset transfer involving 

virtual assets that amount to no less than $8,000, 

an FI should keep all documents and records                

> 134 An FI should include the names of relevant parties in the screening, and should take into

mentioned in paragraph 8.3 for a period of at least 

five years beginning on the date on which the 

occasional transaction is completed.

> Sch. 2

12.9.2 In addition to the documents and records required 

to be kept and the period of time such documents 

and records are required to be kept pursuant to 

paragraphs 8.5 and 8.6, an FI should keep the 

required originator and recipient information set out 

in paragraphs 12.11.5 and 12.11.6 obtained or 

received by the FI in relation to a virtual asset 

transfer referred to in paragraphs 12.11.5 to 

12.11.24, and/or the required originator and 

recipient information set out in paragraph 12.14.2 

obtained by the FI in relation to a virtual asset 

transfer to or from an unhosted wallet referred to in 

paragraphs 12.14, for a period of at least five years 

after the completion of the transfer, regardless of 

whether the business relationship ends during the 

period. 

## 12.1 0 Third -party deposits and payments 

General 

12.10.1 For the purposes of Chapter 11 , paragraphs 5.18 

to 5.20 and 12.10, unless otherwise specified, 

when an FI handles deposits and payments in the 

form of virtual assets on behalf of its customer, the 

term “third-party deposits or payments” covers both 

third-party deposits or payments in the form of 

funds (i.e. fiat currency) and virtual assets. 

12.10.2 Where a customer uses a third party to make or 

receive payments in the form of virtual assets to or 

from an FI, there is a risk that the arrangement 

may be used to disguise the true beneficial owner 

or the source of funds. There are increased risks 

that these transactions are linked to predicate 

offences (such as online scams, ransomware and 

other cybercrimes, insider dealing and market 

manipulation), or used to launder illicit proceeds 

obtained elsewhere. 157 

Policies and procedures 

12.10.3 In relation to the policies and procedures for the 

acceptance of third-party deposits and payments 

as required under paragraph 11.3, the policies and 

procedures of an FI should also address the 

monitoring systems and controls for identifying 

transactions involving third-party deposits or 

payments in the form of virtual assets 136 (please 

refer to paragraph 12.10.6). 

12.10.4 In relation to the guidance in paragraph 11.3(d) 

requiring FIs to have policies and procedures for 

the exceptional situations under which delayed due 

diligence or evaluation may be allowed, it should 

be noted that delayed due diligence on the source 

of a deposit or evaluation of a third-party deposit 

does not apply to a deposit in the form of virtual 

assets considering the nature and ML/TF risks 

associated with virtual assets. 

12.10.5 To facilitate the prompt identification of the sources 

of deposits in the form of virtual assets, FIs are 

strongly encouraged to whitelist accounts (or wallet 

addresses as appropriate 137 ) owned or controlled 

by their clients or any acceptable third parties for 

the making of all such deposits. This will make it 

easier for FIs to ascertain whether the deposits 

have originated from their clients or any acceptable 

third parties 138 . 

> 136

Unlike payments in the form of funds which are usually made to bank accounts designated in 

the name of a payee which can be easily identified by an FI before making payments, payments 

in the form of virtual assets are usually made to wallet addresses which are not designated in 

the name of a payee. Hence, an FI should put in place monitoring systems and controls for 

identifying transactions involving a third party for both deposits and payments in the form of 

virtual assets (e.g. by ascertaining the ownership or control of the account or wallet address).  

> 137

When whitelisting accounts (or wallet addresses as appropriate) owned or controlled by its 

clients or any acceptable third parties, an FI should only accept wallet addresses that the FI has 

assessed to be reliable and have regard to the relevant requirements set out in paragraphs 

12.10.6, 12.10.7 and 12.14.3(b).  

> 138

Likewise, if applicable, the use of whitelisted accounts (or wallet addresses as appropriate) 

owned or controlled by any acceptable third parties for the making of withdrawals will make it 

easier for FIs to complete the necessary due diligence to determine the acceptability of a third-

party payee before effecting a third-party payment. 158 

12.10.6 For deposits and payments in the form of virtual 

assets, the nature and extent of monitoring 

systems and controls set out in paragraph 12.10.3 

should be commensurate with the channel of 

deposits or payments (i.e. whether the deposits or 

payments were made via a VA transfer 

counterparty (referred to in paragraphs 12.13) or 

an unhosted wallet (referred to in paragraphs 

12.14)), having regard to the associated ML/TF 

risks 139 .

For a virtual asset deposit or payment made via an 

ordering or beneficiary institution that presents low 

ML/TF risk, the required originator or recipient 

information verified by the ordering or beneficiary 

institution may be sufficient for an FI to ascertain 

whether the transaction involves a third party 140 .

Conversely, where a virtual asset deposit or 

payment is made via an ordering or beneficiary 

institution that presents higher ML/TF risk or an 

unhosted wallet, the FI should ascertain the 

customer’s ownership or control of the account (or 

wallet address as appropriate) maintained with the 

ordering or beneficiary institution, or the unhosted 

wallet, by taking appropriate measures, for 

example: 

(a) using appropriate confirmation methods 141 ; and 

(b) obtaining evidence from the customer such as 

statement of account issued by the VA transfer 

counterparty. 

Due diligence process for assessing third-party deposits and payments 

12.10.7 In addition to the due diligence process set out in 

paragraphs 11.5 to 11.8, an FI should take               

> 139 Where applicable, an FI should have regard to the results of the counterparty due diligence as
> set out in paragraphs 12.13.
> 140 In other words, this means that whether the originator and the recipient are the same person.
> 141 Examples of confirmation methods may include requesting the customer to perform the
> micropayment test (i.e. by effecting a virtual asset transfer with an (typically small) amount
> specified by the FI) or message signing test (i.e. by signing a message specified by the FI which
> is then verified by the FI). 159

reasonable measures on a risk-sensitive basis to 

ascertain the third party’s ownership of the account 

(or wallet address as appropriate). For a virtual 

asset deposit or payment made via an ordering or 

beneficiary institution that presents low ML/TF risk, 

it may be sufficient for an FI to rely on the required 

originator or recipient information verified by the 

ordering or beneficiary institution for ascertaining 

the third party’s ownership of the account. 

Conversely, where a virtual asset deposit or 

payment is made via an ordering or beneficiary 

institution that presents higher ML/TF risk or an 

unhosted wallet, the FI should use its best 

endeavours to ascertain the third party’s ownership 

or control of the account (or wallet address as 

appropriate) maintained with the ordering or 

beneficiary institution, or the unhosted wallet, by 

taking appropriate measures which may include 

the examples mentioned in paragraph 12.10.6. 

## 12. 11 Virtual asset transfers 

General 

12.11.1 An FI should comply with section 13A of Schedule 

2, the guidance and requirements set out in 

paragraphs 12.11 to 12.14 as well as (where 

applicable) relevant circulars and frequently asked 

questions published by the SFC from time to time 

when acting as an ordering institution, an 

intermediary institution or a beneficiary institution 

as defined in paragraph 12.11.4 in a virtual asset 

transfer, and/or when conducting virtual asset 

transfers to or from an unhosted wallet 142 .

For the avoidance of doubt, where an FI is the 

originator or recipient of a virtual asset transfer, it is 

not acting as an ordering institution, an 

intermediary institution or a beneficiary institution 

and is thus not required to comply with the 

requirements under section 13A of Schedule 2 and  

> 142 Refer to paragraph 12.1.9 for the meaning of “unhosted wallets”. 160

paragraphs 12.11.5 to 12.11.24, 12.12 and 12.13 

in respect of that transaction. 

12.11.2 To prevent criminals and terrorists from having 

unfettered opportunities to move their assets 

through virtual asset transfers and to detect such 

misuse when it occurs, an FI must take all 

reasonable measures to ensure that proper 

safeguards exist to mitigate the ML/TF risks 

associated with virtual asset transfers. 

In particular, an FI should establish and maintain 

effective procedures to ensure compliance with: 

(a) the virtual asset transfers requirements under 

paragraphs 12.11.5 to 12.11.24 (a.k.a. travel 

rule 143 ); and 

(b) other relevant requirements under paragraphs 

12.12 to 12.14, 

to enable it to carry out sanctions screening and 

transaction monitoring procedures on all relevant 

parties involved in a virtual asset transfer in an 

effective manner. 

Virtual asset transfers to or from an institution 

12.11.3 Paragraphs 12.11.5 to 12.11.24, 12.12 and 12.13 

apply to virtual asset transfers to or from an 

institution, including an institution that is a VASP or 

financial institution (referred to in paragraph 12.6.1) 

located in a place within or outside Hong Kong. 

Requirements that apply to virtual asset transfers 

to or from unhosted wallets are set out in 

paragraphs 12.14.

12.11.4 Section 13A of Schedule 2, paragraphs 12.11.5 to 

12.11.24, 12.12 and 12.13 apply to a virtual asset 

transfer that is a transaction carried out: 

(a) by an institution (the ordering institution) on 

behalf of a person (the originator) by 

transferring any virtual assets; and 

(b) with a view to making the virtual assets 

available: 

(i) to that person or another person (the 

recipient); and 

(ii) at an institution (the beneficiary institution), 

which may be the ordering institution or 

another institution, 

whether or not one or more other institutions 

(intermediary institutions) participate in completion 

of the transfer of the virtual assets. 

An FI should comply with the corresponding 

requirements set out in paragraphs 12.11.5 to 

12.11.24 when acting as an ordering institution, an 

intermediary institution or a beneficiary institution 

(as the case may be) in a virtual asset transfer. 

Ordering institutions

and place of birth; 

(d) the recipient’s name; and 

(e) the number of the recipient’s account 

maintained with the beneficiary institution and

record the following originator and recipient 

information: 

(a) the originator’s name; 

(b) the number of the originator’s account 

maintained with the ordering institution and 

from which the virtual assets are transferred or, 

in the absence of such an account, a unique

to which the virtual assets are transferred or, in 

the absence of such an account, a unique 

reference number assigned to the virtual asset 

transfer by the beneficiary institution. 

12.11.7 Where applicable, the number of the account 

maintained with the ordering institution or 

beneficiary institution from or to which the virtual 

assets are transferred referred to in paragraphs 

12.11.5 and 12.11.6 could mean the wallet address 

of the originator or recipient maintained with the 

ordering institution or beneficiary institution and 

used to process the transaction. 

12.11.8 The unique reference number assigned to the 

virtual asset transfer by the ordering institution or 

beneficiary institution referred to in paragraphs 

12.11.5 and 12.11.6 should permit traceability of 

the virtual asset transfer.  

> s.13A(4),
> Sch.2

12.11.9 An ordering institution must submit the required 

originator and recipient information obtained and 

held under paragraphs 12.11.5 and 12.11.6 

(hereafter referred to as "required information") to 

the beneficiary institution securely (see paragraph 

12.11.12).  

> s.13A(4),
> Sch.2

12.11.10 In addition, the ordering institution must submit the 

required information to the beneficiary institution 

immediately (see paragraph 12.11.13). 

12.11.11 For the avoidance of doubt, the required 

information may be submitted either directly or 

indirectly to the beneficiary institution provided that 

it is submitted in accordance with the requirements 

set out in paragraphs 12.11.9 and 12.11.10. This 

means that it is not necessary for the required 

information to be attached directly to, or be 

included in, the virtual asset transfer itself. 

12.11.12 “Securely” referred to in paragraph 12.11.9 means 

that the ordering institution should store and submit 

the required information in a secure manner to 164 

protect the integrity and availability of the required 

information for facilitating record-keeping and the 

use of such information by the beneficiary 

institution and, where applicable, the intermediary 

institution, in fulfilling its AML/CFT obligations 147 ;

and protect the information from unauthorised 

access or disclosure. 

To ensure that the required information is 

submitted in a secure manner, an ordering 

institution should 148 :

(a) undertake the VA transfer counterparty due 

diligence measures as set out in paragraphs 

12.13 to determine whether the beneficiary 

institution and, where applicable, the 

intermediary institution can reasonably be 

expected to adequately protect the 

confidentiality and integrity of the information 

submitted to it; and 

(b) take other appropriate measures and controls, 

for example: 

(i) entering into a bilateral data sharing 

agreement with the beneficiary institution 

and, where applicable, the intermediary 

institution and/or (where applicable) a

service-level agreement with the 

technological solution provider for travel 

rule compliance (see paragraphs 12.12) 

which specifies the responsibilities of the 

institutions involved and/or of the provider 

to ensure the protection of the 

confidentiality and integrity of the 

information submitted; 

(ii) using, or ensuring the technological 

solution adopted for travel rule compliance 

(where applicable) uses, a strong 

encryption algorithm to encrypt the

165 

information during the data submission; 

and 

(iii) implementing adequate information 

security controls to prevent unauthorised 

access, disclosure or alteration. 

For the avoidance of doubt, an ordering institution 

should not execute a virtual asset transfer when it 

could not ensure that the required information 

could be submitted to a beneficiary institution, and 

where applicable, an intermediary institution, in a 

secure manner having regard to the above 

guidance and the VA transfer counterparty due 

diligence results. 

12.11.13 “Immediately” referred to in paragraph 12.11.10 

means that the ordering institution should submit 

the required information prior to, or simultaneously 

or concurrently with, the virtual asset transfer (i.e. 

the submission must occur before or when the 

virtual asset transfer is conducted) 149 .

12.11.14 An ordering institution should keep records and 

relevant documents so that it can demonstrate to 

the relevant authority whether and how the 

required information is submitted to a beneficiary 

institution in accordance with the requirements set 

out in paragraphs 12.11.9 and 12.11.10 150 .

12.11.15 For a virtual asset transfer involving virtual assets 

that amount to not less than $8,000, an ordering 

institution must ensure that the required originator

(1A), 

Sch.2 

12.11.16 For an occasional virtual asset transfer 152 involving 

virtual assets that amount to not less than $8,000, 

an ordering institution must verify the identity of the 

originator 153 . For an occasional virtual asset 

transfer involving virtual assets that amount to less 

than $8,000, the ordering institution is in general 

not required to verify the originator’s identity, 

except when several transactions are carried out 

which appear to the ordering institution to be linked 

and amount to not less than $8,000, or when there 

is a suspicion of ML/TF. 

12.11.17 The ordering institution should not execute a virtual 

asset transfer unless it has ensured compliance 

with the requirements in paragraphs 12.11.5 to 

12.11.16. 

Intermediary institutions 

s.13A(6), 

Sch.2 12.11.18 An intermediary institution must ensure that all 

originator and recipient information as set out in 

paragraphs 12.11.5 and 12.11.6 which the 

intermediary institution receives in connection with 

the virtual asset transfer is retained with the 

required information submission, and is transmitted 

to the institution to which it passes on the transfer 

instruction 154 . 

> 151

“Accurate” in this context means information that has been verified for accuracy as part of its 

CDD process. For example, if the originator's address is part of the required information to be 

submitted by the ordering institution as set out in paragraphs 12.11.9 and 12.11.10, the ordering 

institution should ensure that the originator's address is accurate having regard to the CDD 

information obtained pursuant to paragraph 4.2.4, 4.2.5 or 4.2.10 as appropriate.  

> 152

It should be noted that FIs that are LCs or SFC-licensed VAS Providers should not carry out 

occasional virtual asset transfers.  

> 153

For the avoidance of doubt, where the originator is a customer of an FI, the FI does not need to 

re-verify the identity of the customer that has been verified (unless doubts arise as to veracity or 

adequacy of the information previously obtained for the purposes of customer identification and 

verification).

(a) taking reasonable measures (e.g. real-time or 

post-event monitoring) to identify virtual asset 

transfers that lack the required information; and 

(b) having risk-based policies and procedures for 

determining: (i) whether and when to execute, 

suspend (i.e. prevent the relevant virtual assets 

from being made available to the recipient) a 

virtual asset transfer lacking the required 

information or, where appropriate, return the 

relevant virtual assets to the account of the

## 12.12 Virtual asset transfers – Technological solutions 

## for travel rule compliance 

12.12.1 An FI may adopt any technological solution to 

submit and/or obtain the required information for a 

virtual asset transfer provided that the solution 

enables the FI to comply with the travel rule as set 

out in paragraphs 12.11.5 to 12.11.24, when it acts 

as an ordering institution, an intermediary 

institution or a beneficiary institution. 

12.12.2 Where an FI chooses to use a technological 

solution to ensure travel rule compliance, it 

remains responsible for discharging its AML/CFT 

obligations in relation to travel rule compliance. 

The FI should conduct due diligence to satisfy itself 

that the solution enables it to comply with the travel 

rule in an effective and efficient manner. In 

particular, the FI should consider whether the 

solution enables it to: 

(a) identify VA transfer counterparties (see 

paragraphs 12.13); and 

(b) submit the required information immediately 

(see paragraph 12.11.13) and securely (see 

paragraph 12.11.12) (i.e. whether the solution 

could protect the submitted information from 

unauthorised access, disclosure or alteration), 

and obtain the required information 158 .

12.12.3 In addition, an FI should consider a range of                          

> 158 In considering whether the solution enables the FI to obtain the required information, the FI

factors as appropriate when conducting due 

diligence on the technological solution for travel 

rule compliance, such as: 

(a) the interoperability of the solution with other 

similar solution(s) adopted by the VA transfer 

counterparties that the FI may deal with; 

(b) whether the solution allows the required 

information for a large volume of virtual asset 

transfers to be submitted immediately and 

securely to and/or obtained from multiple VA 

transfer counterparties in a stable manner; 

(c) whether the solution enables the FI to 

implement measures or controls for the 

effective scrutiny of virtual asset transfers to 

identify and report suspicious transactions (as 

set out in paragraphs 12.7.2 to 12.7.4 and 

12.7.6), and screening of virtual asset transfers 

to meet the sanctions obligations (i.e. taking 

freezing actions and prohibiting virtual asset 

transfers with designated persons and entities) 

(as set out in paragraphs 12.8.1 to 12.8.3); 

(d) whether the solution facilitates the FI in 

conducting VA transfer counterparty due 

diligence (see paragraphs 12.13) and 

requesting additional information from the VA 

transfer counterparty as and when necessary; 

and 

(e) whether the solution facilitates the FI in 

keeping the required information (see 

paragraph 12.9.2). 

## 12.13 VA transfer counterparty due diligence and 

## additional measures 

Introduction 

12.13.1 When an FI conducts a virtual asset transfer 

referred to in paragraphs 12.11.5 to 12.11.24, the 

FI will be exposed to ML/TF risks associated with 

the institution which may be the ordering institution, 

intermediary institution or beneficiary institution 

involved in the virtual asset transfer (hereafter 171 

collectively referred to as “VA transfer 

counterparty”), which may vary depending on a 

number of factors, including: 

(a) the types of products and services offered by 

the VA transfer counterparty; 

(b) the types of customers to which the VA transfer 

counterparty provides services; 

(c) geographical exposures of the VA transfer 

counterparty and its customers; 

(d) the AML/CFT regime in the jurisdictions in 

which the VA transfer counterparty operates 

and/or is incorporated; and 

(e) the adequacy and effectiveness of the 

AML/CFT controls of the VA transfer 

counterparty. 

12.13.2 To avoid sending or receiving virtual assets to or 

from illicit actors or designated parties that had not 

been subject to the appropriate CDD and 

screening measures undertaken by a VA transfer 

counterparty and to ensure compliance with the 

travel rule, an FI should conduct due diligence on 

the VA transfer counterparty to identify and assess 

the ML/TF risks associated with the virtual asset 

transfers to or from the VA transfer counterparty 

and apply appropriate risk-based AML/CFT 

measures. 

VA transfer counterparty due diligence measures 

12.13.3 An FI should conduct due diligence measures on a 

VA transfer counterparty before conducting a

virtual asset transfer or making the transferred 

virtual assets available to the recipient. 

If an FI conducts virtual asset transfers with several 

VA transfer counterparties located in different 

jurisdictions but belonging to the same group, the 

FI, whilst conducting due diligence on each of the 

VA transfer counterparties independently, should 

also take into account that these counterparties 

belong to the same group in order to holistically 172 

assess the ML/TF risks posed by the 

counterparties. 

12.13.4 An FI does not need to undertake the VA transfer 

counterparty due diligence process for every 

individual virtual asset transfer when dealing with 

VA transfer counterparties that it has previously 

conducted counterparty due diligence on, unless 

when there is a suspicion of ML/TF or when the FI 

is aware of any heightened ML/TF risks from its 

ongoing monitoring of virtual asset transfers with 

VA transfer counterparties (see paragraph 

12.13.10). 

12.13.5 VA transfer counterparty due diligence typically 

involves the following procedures: 

(a) determining whether the virtual asset transfer 

is or will be with a VA transfer counterparty or 

an unhosted wallet; 

(b) where applicable, identifying the VA transfer 

counterparty (e.g. by making reference to lists 

of licensed or registered VASPs or financial 

institutions in different jurisdictions); and 

(c) assessing whether the VA transfer 

counterparty is an eligible counterparty to deal 

with and to send the required information to 

(see paragraphs 12.13.6 to 12.13.9). 

12.13.6 An FI should adopt an RBA in applying the 

following due diligence measures on a VA transfer 

counterparty, taking into account relevant factors 

such as those set out in paragraph 12.13.1: 

(a) collect sufficient information about the VA 

transfer counterparty to enable it to understand 173 

fully the nature of the VA transfer 

counterparty’s business 159 ;

(b) understand the nature 160 and expected volume 

and value of virtual asset transfers with the VA 

transfer counterparty; 

(c) determine from publicly available information 

the reputation of the VA transfer counterparty 

and the quality and effectiveness of the 

AML/CFT regulation and supervision over the 

VA transfer counterparty by authorities in the 

jurisdictions in which it operates and/or is 

incorporated which perform functions similar to 

those of the RAs; 

(d) assess the AML/CFT controls of the VA 

transfer counterparty and be satisfied that the 

AML/CFT controls of the VA transfer 

counterparty are adequate and effective; and 

(e) obtain approval from its senior management. 

12.13.7 While a relationship with a VA transfer 

counterparty is different from a cross-border 

correspondent relationship referred to in paragraph 

12.6.1, there are similarities in the due diligence 

approach which can be of assistance to an FI. By 

virtue of this, the FI should conduct the due 

diligence measures in paragraph 12.13.6, with 

reference to the requirements set out in 

paragraphs 4.20.7 to 4.20.10 and 12.6.3 to 

12.6.4 161 .

12.13.8 As part of the VA transfer counterparty due  

> 159

While an FI should determine on a risk-sensitive basis the amount of information to collect about 

the VA transfer counterparty to enable it to understand the nature of the VA transfer 

counterparty’s business, the FI should, among other things, endeavour to identify and verify the 

identity of the VA transfer counterparty using documents, data or information provided by a 

reliable and independent source; and take reasonable measures to understand the ownership 

and control structure of the VA transfer counterparty, with the objective to follow the chain of 

ownerships to its beneficial owners.  

> 160

For example, the extent to which any of the virtual asset transfers and relevant underlying 

customers (who may be the originator or recipient of a virtual asset transfer) are assessed as 

high risk by the VA transfer counterparty.  

> 161

For the purposes of paragraph 12.13.7, any reference to “cross-border correspondent 

relationship" and “respondent institution" in paragraphs 4.20.7 to 4.20.10 and 12.6.3 to 12.6.4 

refers to “VA transfer counterparty relationship" and “VA transfer counterparty" respectively. 174 

diligence measures in relation to its AML/CFT 

controls, an FI should assess whether the VA 

transfer counterparty can comply with the travel 

rule, taking into account relevant factors such as: 

(a) whether the VA transfer counterparty is subject 

to requirements similar to the travel rule 

imposed under section 13A of Schedule 2 and 

this Chapter in the jurisdictions in which the VA 

transfer counterparty operates and/or is 

incorporated; and 

(b) the adequacy and effectiveness of the 

AML/CFT controls that the VA transfer 

counterparty has put in place for ensuring 

compliance with the travel rule. 

In addition, the FI should assess whether the VA 

transfer counterparty can protect the confidentiality 

and integrity of personal data (e.g. the required 

originator and recipient information), taking into 

account the adequacy and robustness of data 

privacy and security controls of the VA transfer 

counterparty 162 .

12.13.9 When assessing the ML/TF risks posed by a VA 

transfer counterparty, an FI should take into 

account relevant factors that may indicate a higher 

ML/TF risk, for example, a VA transfer counterparty 

that: 

(a) operates or is incorporated in a jurisdiction 

posing a higher risk or with a weak AML/CFT 

regime; 

(b) is not (or is yet to be) licensed or registered 

and supervised for AML/CFT purposes in the 

jurisdictions in which it operates and/or is 

incorporated by authorities which perform 

functions similar to those of the RAs; 

(c) does not have in place adequate and effective  

> 162 This is to ensure that, among other things, the required information is submitted in a secure
> manner as mentioned in paragraph 12.11.12. 175

AML/CFT Systems, including measures for 

ensuring compliance with the travel rule; 

(d) does not implement adequate measures or 

safeguards for protecting the confidentiality 

and integrity of personal data; or 

(e) is associated with ML/TF or other illicit 

activities. 

Ongoing monitoring 

12.13.10 An FI should monitor the VA transfer 

counterparties on an ongoing basis, including: 

(a) adopting an RBA in monitoring virtual asset 

transfers with VA transfer counterparties with a 

view to detecting any unexpected or unusual 

activities or transactions and any changes in 

the risk profiles of the VA transfer 

counterparties, taking into account the 

transaction monitoring requirements in Chapter 

5 and paragraphs 12.7.2 to 12.7.4 and 12.7.6; 

and 

(b) reviewing the information obtained by the FI 

from applying the VA transfer counterparty due 

diligence measures under paragraph 12.13.6 

on a regular basis and/or upon trigger events 

(e.g. when the FI is aware of any heightened 

ML/TF risks from its ongoing monitoring of 

virtual asset transfers with VA transfer 

counterparties or other information such as 

negative news from credible media or public 

information that the counterparty has been 

subject to any targeted financial sanction, 

ML/TF investigation or regulatory action) and, 

where appropriate, updating its risk 

assessment of a VA transfer counterparty. 

Based on the VA transfer counterparty due 

diligence results, the FI should determine if it 

should continue to conduct virtual asset transfers 

with, and submit the required information to, a VA 

transfer counterparty, and the extent of AML/CFT 

measures that it should apply in relation to virtual 176 

asset transfers with the VA transfer counterparty 

on a risk-sensitive basis 163 .

Other risk mitigating measures 

12.13.11 An FI should assess how the ML/TF risks identified 

from the VA transfer counterparty due diligence 

may affect it, and take reasonable measures on a 

risk-sensitive basis to mitigate and manage the 

ML/TF risks posed by a VA transfer 

counterparty 164 , which include: 

(a) perform enhanced and/or more frequent due 

diligence reviews; 

(b) conduct enhanced monitoring of virtual asset 

transfers with the VA transfer counterparty; and 

(c) (where appropriate) impose transaction limits, 

when dealing with a VA transfer counterparty that 

presents a higher ML/TF risk. 

12.13.12 An FI should also determine on a risk-sensitive 

basis whether to restrict or continue to deal with, or 

refrain from executing or facilitating any virtual 

asset transfers to or from, a VA transfer 

counterparty that presents higher ML/TF risks. 

If the FI cannot mitigate and manage the ML/TF 

risks posed by a VA transfer counterparty, it should 

refrain from executing or facilitating such virtual 

asset transfers. 

12.13.13 An FI must not conduct virtual asset transfers with 

a VA transfer counterparty that is a shell VASP or 

shell financial institution 165 .   

> 163 Further guidance on risk mitigating measures is set out in paragraphs 12.13.11 to 12.13.13.

177 

## 12.14 Virtual asset transfers to or from unhosted wallets 

12.14.1 Peer-to-peer transactions associated with 

unhosted wallets 166 may be attractive to illicit actors 

given the anonymity and mobility of virtual assets 

and that there is typically no intermediary involved 

in the peer-to-peer transactions to carry out 

AML/CFT measures such as CDD and transaction 

monitoring. An FI should comply with the 

requirements set out in paragraphs 12.14.2 and 

12.14.3 when conducting virtual asset transfers to 

or from unhosted wallets so as to mitigate the 

associated ML/TF risks. 

12.14.2 Before an FI sends or receives virtual assets to or 

from an unhosted wallet on behalf of its customer 

(i.e. the originator or the recipient, as the case may 

be), the FI should obtain the following originator 

and recipient information from the customer 167 and 

record: 

(a) in relation to a virtual asset transfer to an 

unhosted wallet, 

(i) the originator’s name; 

(ii) the number of the originator’s account 

maintained with the FI and from which the 

virtual assets are transferred or, in the 

absence of such an account, a unique 

reference number assigned to the virtual 

asset transfer by the FI; 

(iii) the originator’s address, the originator’s 

customer identification number or 

identification document number or, if the 

originator is an individual, the originator’s 

date and place of birth;    

> 166 Refer to paragraph 12.1.9 for the meaning of “unhosted wallets”.
> 167 For the avoidance of doubt, an FI is not required to obtain the originator information (for a virtual
> asset transfer to an unhosted wallet) or the recipient information (for a virtual asset transfer from
> an unhosted wallet) from a customer that is the originator or recipient respectively for every
> individual virtual asset transfer to or from an unhosted wallet (unless doubts arise as to veracity
> or adequacy of the information previously obtained for the purposes of customer identification
> and verification). For the purposes of paragraph 12.14.2, an FI is not required to obtain the
> information in (a)(iii) and (b)(iii) set out therein for a virtual asset transfer to or from an unhosted
> wallet involving virtual assets that amount to less than $8,000.

178 

(iv) the recipient’s name; and 

(v) the recipient’s wallet address; 

(b) in relation to a virtual asset transfer from an 

unhosted wallet, 

(i) the originator’s name; 

(ii) the originator’s wallet address; 

(iii) the originator’s address, the originator’s 

customer identification number or 

identification document number or, if the 

originator is an individual, the originator’s 

date and place of birth; 

(iv) the recipient’s name; and 

(v) the number of the recipient’s account 

maintained with the FI and to which the 

virtual assets are transferred or, in the 

absence of such an account, a unique 

reference number assigned to the virtual 

asset transfer by the FI. 

12.14.3 An FI should also assess the ML/TF risks 

associated with virtual asset transfers to or from 

unhosted wallets and take reasonable measures 

on a risk-sensitive basis to mitigate and manage 

the ML/TF risks associated with the transfers 168 ,

which include: 

(a) conduct enhanced monitoring of virtual asset 

transfers with unhosted wallets; 

(b) accept virtual asset transfers only to or from 

unhosted wallets that the FI has assessed to 

be reliable 169 , having regard to the screening 

results of the virtual asset transactions and the 

associated wallet addresses (see paragraphs 

12.7.2 to 12.7.4 and 12.7.6) and the       

> 168 In particular, the FI should implement appropriate measures to mitigate and manage the risks
> posed by virtual asset transfers to or from third parties and ensure compliance with the
> requirements in Chapter 11 and paragraphs 12.10.
> 169 For example, an FI may implement controls to prevent the relevant virtual assets from an

179 

assessment results of the ownership or control 

of the unhosted wallet 170 (see paragraphs 

12.10.6 and 12.10.7); and 

(c) (where appropriate) impose transaction 

limits 171 .

## 12.15 Illustrative risk indicators for assessing ML/TF 

## risks 

12.15.1 In addition to the non-exhaustive illustrative risk 

indicators for institutional risk assessment and 

customer risk assessment set out in Appendix A, 

paragraphs 12.15 set out non-exhaustive 

illustrative risk indicators in relation to virtual 

assets. 

Customer risk 

12.15.2 Examples of customers 172 that may present higher 

ML/TF risk include: 

(a) where the origin of wealth is substantially 

derived from activities that may present higher 

risks, e.g. initial coin offerings which are known 

to associate with predicate offences for ML/TF 

or financial crimes; virtual asset activities 

conducted via VASPs that are unregulated or 

with lax AML/CFT controls; 

(b) a customer who appears to operate as an 

unregulated VASP on peer-to-peer platforms, 

particularly when the customer handles or 

conducts frequent and/or large virtual asset 

transfers or transactions on behalf of its 

underlying customer(s), and charges higher              

> 170 Where virtual assets are transferred to or from an unhosted wallet that has been whitelisted in
> accordance with the requirements in paragraph 12.10.5, an FI should ascertain the ownership or

service fees compared to other VASPs; 

(c) a customer’s wallet(s) used for deposit and 

withdrawal exhibit(s) patterns of virtual asset 

transactions associated with the use of 

anonymity-enhancing technologies or 

mechanisms (e.g. mixers, tumblers) or peer-to-

peer platforms; and 

(d) a customer who is a VASP sets up offices in, 

or moves offices to, jurisdictions for no 

apparent business reason or posing a higher 

risk (especially those that neither prohibit nor 

regulate virtual asset-related activities or 

services). 

Product/service/transaction risk 

12.15.3 Examples of products, services or transactions 173 

that may present higher ML/TF risk include: 

(a) products or services that may inherently favour 

anonymity or obscure information about 

underlying customer transactions, especially 

those involving the use of anonymity-

enhancing technologies or mechanisms, or that 

are not supported by any technological 

solutions adopted for screening of virtual asset 

transactions and the associated wallet 

addresses 174 ;

(b) deposits from or payments to unknown or 

unrelated third parties in the form of virtual 

assets; 

(c) virtual assets that have been associated with 

fraud, market abuse or other illicit activities; 

(d) the purchase of virtual assets using physical 

cash; and 

(e) virtual asset-related products or services 

funded by payments from or instructions given 

by unexpected third parties, particularly from   

> 173 These product, service and transaction risk indicators are also relevant to FIs that are not SFC-

jurisdictions posing a higher risk. 

## 12.16 Illustrative indicators of suspicious transactions 

## and activities 

12.16.1 In addition to the non-exhaustive illustrative 

indicators of suspicious transactions and activities 

set out in Appendix B, paragraphs 12.16 set out 

non-exhaustive illustrative indicators of suspicious 

transactions and activities in relation to virtual 

assets. 

Customer-related 

12.16.2 (a) A customer who has no discernible reason for 

using the FI’s services (e.g. a customer has 

opened an account for virtual asset trading 

services but only deposits fiat currency or 

virtual assets and subsequently withdraws the 

entire balance or a substantial portion of the 

deposited assets without other activity; or a 

customer located in a place outside Hong Kong 

who opens an account with the FI to trade 

virtual assets that are also available from 

VASPs located in that place 175 ); 

(b) Requests by customers for virtual asset trading 

services or virtual asset transfers where the 

source of the funds is unclear or not consistent 

with the customers' profile and apparent 

standing; 

(c) A customer who enters an FI's platform and/or 

initiates transactions from an IP address that 

may present higher risks, for example: 

(i) from jurisdictions posing a higher risk; 

(ii) not in line with the customer's profile (e.g. 

IP address from a jurisdiction which is not 

the customer's place of residence or 

principal business); 

(iii) previously identified as suspicious by the 

FI; or  

> 175 This may, for example, include situations where an FI acts as a respondent institution and
> provides trading services for virtual assets through a cross-border correspondent relationship
> with a correspondent institution (see paragraphs 4.20.1 and 12.6.1). 182

(iv) associated with a darknet market or 

software that increases anonymity or 

allows anonymous communications (e.g. 

proxies, unverifiable IP geographical 

location, virtual private networks, The 

Onion Router (Tor)); 

(d) A customer and other apparently unrelated 

customer(s) entering the FI's platform from the 

same IP or MAC address; 

(e) A customer who frequently changes contact 

information, e.g. email address, phone number, 

especially when those are disposable or 

temporary 176 ; and 

(f) A customer who frequently or over a short 

period of time, e.g. within a few hours, changes 

the IP address or device used to enter the FI's 

platform and/or conduct transactions. 

Trading-related 

12.16.3 (a) Buying and selling of virtual assets with no 

discernible purpose or where the nature, size 

or frequency of the transactions appears 

unusual. For example, where a customer 

repeatedly conducts virtual asset transactions 

with a particular person or group of persons at 

a significant profit or considerable loss, which 

may indicate that the transactions are used to 

transfer value or obfuscate funds flow as part 

of a ML/TF scheme, or a potential account 

takeover; 

(b) Mirror trades or transactions involving virtual 

assets used for currency conversion for 

illegitimate or no apparent business purposes; 

(c) Converting virtual assets to fiat currency at a 

potential loss with no apparent commercial 

rationale regardless of, for example, the price 

fluctuations or high commission fees; and 

(d) Conversion of a large amount of fiat currency              

> 176 This may also indicate a potential account takeover against a customer (i.e. a fraudster poses

or virtual assets into other or multiple types of 

virtual assets with no logical or apparent 

reason which obscures the flow of funds. 

Market abuse activities-related 

12.16.4 (a) Placing of buy and sell orders in close 

chronological sequence for accounts with the 

same beneficial owner or of connected persons 

in the same virtual assets which are thinly-

traded; 

(b) Multiple new customers are referred by the 

same individual to open accounts for trading in 

the same virtual asset within a short period of 

time; 

(c) A customer engages in prearranged or other 

non-competitive trading in particular virtual 

assets; 

(d) The entry of matching buy and sell orders in 

specific virtual assets (“wash trading”), creating 

the illusion of active trading with no change in 

the beneficial ownership of the virtual assets. 

Such wash trading does not result in a bona 

fide market position, which might also provide 

“cover” for a money launderer; 

(e) Accumulation of a virtual asset with small 

increments in price to gradually increase the 

price of the virtual asset over a period of time; 

(f) A customer makes large purchases of a virtual 

asset, particularly a virtual asset which is thinly-

traded, within a short period of time, and the 

size of the transactions is incommensurate with 

the customer’s profile; and 

(g) A group of customers sharing the same trading 

patterns (e.g. purchasing the same virtual asset 

at the same or similar time or price), particularly 

in relation to a virtual asset which is thinly-

traded, authorise the same person or third 

party to operate their accounts and/or transfer 

fiat currency or virtual assets amongst their 

accounts. 184 

Related to movement of funds and virtual assets 

12.16.5 (a) A customer uses an FI to make payments or to 

hold funds or other property that are rarely 

used or are not being used to trade in virtual 

assets, i.e. the account appears to be used as 

a depositary account or a conduit for transfers; 

(b) Transfers of positions, funds, virtual assets or 

other property between accounts of parties that 

do not appear to be commonly controlled or 

have an apparent relationship; 

(c) Frequent funds, virtual assets or other property 

transfers or cheque payments to or from third 

parties that are unrelated or difficult to verify; 

(d) Transfers of funds or virtual assets to and from 

financial institutions or VASPs located in 

jurisdictions posing a higher risk 177 , or, which 

are not consistent with the customer’s declared 

place of residence, business dealings or 

interests, without reasonable explanation; 

(e) Transfers of funds or virtual assets to the same 

person from different parties, or to different 

persons from the same party without 

reasonable explanation; 

(f) Frequent changes of bank account or wallet 

address details or information for receiving 

funds or virtual assets; 

(g) Multiple transactions involving a high value of 

virtual assets where the nature, frequency or 

pattern of the transactions appears unusual, 

e.g. the transactions are conducted in short 

succession such as within a 24-hour period, or 

in a staggered and regular pattern followed by 

a long period of inactivity; transfer of virtual 

assets to another wallet, particularly a new 

wallet or wallet that has been inactive for a 

period of time, which may indicate possibility of 

ransomware attack or other cybercrimes; 

(h) Virtual assets are transferred from wallet

addresses which are known to hold stolen 

virtual assets, or are known to associate with 

holders of stolen virtual assets; 

(i) Deposits of virtual assets, including those from 

new customers, are immediately followed by 

transactions with no apparent legitimate 

purpose or commercial rationale which incur 

additional or unnecessary cost or fees (e.g. 

converting the deposited virtual assets to other 

or multiple types of virtual assets which 

obfuscates the trail of transactions, and/or 

withdrawing all or part of the deposited virtual 

assets to unhosted wallets immediately); 

(j) Transfers of virtual assets from multiple wallets 

in small amounts, in particular, those that are 

held by third parties, with subsequent transfer 

to another wallet or conversion of the entire 

amount to fiat currency; 

(k) Transactions involving virtual assets that 

provide higher anonymity such as anonymity-

enhanced virtual assets (e.g. depositing a

virtual asset that operates on a public 

blockchain and immediately converting it into a 

virtual asset that provides higher anonymity); 

(l) A customer uses an FI to convert an unusual 

amount (in terms of volume or number) of 

virtual assets from peer-to-peer platforms (e.g. 

a peer-to-peer platform with lax AML/CFT 

controls) into fiat currency for no logical or 

apparent reason; 

(m) Transfers of virtual assets to or from wallet 

addresses presenting higher risks, for 

example, wallet addresses that are directly 

and/or indirectly associated with illicit or 

suspicious activities/sources or designated 

parties 178 ;

virtual assets from virtual asset automatic teller 

machines or kiosks, especially those located in 

jurisdictions posing a higher risk; 

(p) Information or message transmitted with a

virtual asset transfer indicates that the 

transaction may be used to finance or assist 

illicit activities; 

(q) A customer who is a financially vulnerable 

person and/or has no prior knowledge of virtual 

assets engages in frequent and/or large 

transactions (in particular, deposits and 

withdrawals of funds and/or virtual assets) 

through an FI, which may be signs indicating 

money mule or scam victim; 

(r) Deposits of large amounts of virtual assets 

followed by conversion to fiat currencies, 

where the source of the funds is unclear and 

the size of transactions is not in line with the 

background of the customer, which may 

suggest that the deposited virtual assets are 

stolen assets; 

(s) A customer’s funds or virtual assets originate 

from, or are sent to, a financial institution or 

VASP that (i) is not registered or licensed in 

the jurisdiction that it operates from (or where 

the customer to whom it offers products and/or 

services resides or is located), or (ii) operates 

from (or the customer to whom it offers 

products and/or services resides or is located 

in) a jurisdiction that neither prohibits nor 

regulates virtual asset-related activities or 

services; 

(t) The required information in a virtual asset 

transfer is inaccurate or incomplete, for 

example, in the case of an ordering institution, 

discrepancies were noted between the  

> 179 Refer to paragraph 12.1.8 for the meaning of “chain-hopping”. 187

recipient’s information provided by its customer 

and the information maintained by the 

beneficiary institution which may have resulted 

in a rejection of the virtual asset transfer 

request or return of the relevant virtual assets 

by the beneficiary institution, or the information 

noted from the screening of the recipient’s 

wallet address associated with the virtual asset 

transfer (see paragraphs 12.7.2 to 12.7.4 and

(u) A customer with limited or no other assets at 

the FI receives a transfer of large amounts of 

thinly-traded virtual assets; and 

(v) A customer deposits virtual assets and 

requests to credit them to multiple accounts 

that do not appear to be related, and to sell or 

otherwise transfer ownership of the virtual 

assets.

# APPENDIX A Illustrative risk indicators for 

# assessing ML/TF risks 

The following is a list of non-exhaustive illustrative risk indicators for 

institutional risk assessment and customer risk assessment. These 

examples of indicators associated with each risk factor mentioned in 

paragraphs 2.6 and 2.17 may indicate higher or lower ML/TF risks as 

the case may be. 

1 Country risk 

Examples of countries or jurisdictions 181 that may present 

higher ML/TF risk include: 

(a) countries or jurisdictions that have been identified by 

the FATF as jurisdictions with strategic AML/CFT 

deficiencies; 

(b) countries or jurisdictions subject to sanctions, 

embargos or similar measures issued by, for example, 

the UN; 

(c) countries or jurisdictions which are more vulnerable to 

corruption 182 ; and 

(d) countries or jurisdictions that are believed to have 

strong links to terrorist activities. 

Examples of countries or jurisdictions that may be 

considered to carry lower ML/TF risk include: 

(a) countries or jurisdictions identified by credible sources, 

such as mutual evaluation or detailed assessment 

reports, as having effective AML/CFT Systems; and 

(b) countries or jurisdictions identified by credible sources 

as having a low level of corruption or other criminal 

activity.          

> 181 Guidance on jurisdictions posing a higher risk is provided in paragraphs 4.13.
> 182 When assessing which countries are more vulnerable to corruption, FIs may make reference to
> publicly available information or relevant reports and databases on corruption risk published by
> specialised national, international, non-governmental and commercial organisations (an
> example of which is Transparency International’s “Corruption Perceptions Index”, which ranks
> countries according to their perceived level of corruption). 190

2 Customer risk 

Examples of customers that may present higher ML/TF risk 

include: 

(a) the business relationships established in unusual 

circumstances (e.g. a customer instructs an FI to set up 

a discretionary management agreement for an 

investment vehicle owned by the customer but requests 

the FI to buy and sell particular securities for the 

investment vehicle only according to the customer’s 

instructions); 

(b) non-resident customers who have no discernible 

reasons for opening an account with FIs in Hong Kong; 

(c) the use of legal persons or arrangements as personal 

asset-holding vehicles without any commercial or other 

valid reasons; 

(d) companies that have nominee shareholders, nominee 

directors, bearer shares or bearer share warrants; 

(e) customers that engage in, or derive wealth or revenues 

from, cash-intensive businesses; 

(f) the ownership structure of a company appears unusual 

or excessively complex having considered the nature of 

the company’s business; 

(g) the customer or the family member or close associate 

of a customer is a PEP (including where a beneficial 

owner of a customer is a PEP); 

(h) customers that have been mentioned in negative news 

reports from credible media, particularly those related to 

predicate offences for ML/TF or financial crimes; 

(i) nature, scope and location of business activities 

generating the funds 183 may be related to high risk 

activities or jurisdictions posing a higher risk; 

(j) customers that have sanction exposure; 

(k) where the origin of wealth (for high risk customers and 

PEPs) or ownership cannot be easily verified; and 

(l) a customer introduced by an overseas financial 

institution, affiliate or other investor, both of which are 

based in jurisdictions posing a higher risk 184 .  

> 183 Consideration should be given to the risks inherent in the nature of the activity of the customer
> and the possibility that the transaction may itself be a criminal transaction.
> 184 Guidance on jurisdictions posing a higher risk is provided in paragraphs 4.13. 191

Examples of customers that may be considered to carry 

lower ML/TF risk include: 

(a) specific types of customers that may be eligible for SDD 

as specified in paragraph 4.8.3 or simplified measures 

as specified in paragraph 4 of Appendix C; 

(b) customers who are employment-based or with a regular 

source of income from a known legitimate source which 

supports the activity being undertaken; and 

(c) the reputation of the customer, e.g. a well-known, 

reputable private company, with a long history that is 

well documented by independent sources, including 

information regarding its ownership and control. 

3 Product/service/transaction risk 

Examples of products, services or transactions that may 

present higher ML/TF risk include: 

(a) products or services that may inherently favour 

anonymity or obscure information about underlying 

customer transactions; 

(b) products that have the ability to pool underlying 

customers/funds; 

(c) deposits from or payments to unknown or unrelated 

third parties; 

(d) the products or services offered to customers 

associated with jurisdictions posing a higher risk (e.g. 

where a customer resides in a jurisdiction posing a 

higher risk or where the customer’s source of funds or 

source of wealth is mainly derived from jurisdictions 

posing a higher risk); 

(e) products with unusual complexity or structure and with 

no obvious economic purpose; 

(f) products or services that permit the unrestricted or 

anonymous transfer of value (by payment or change of 

asset ownership) to an unrelated third party, particularly 

from jurisdictions posing a higher risk; 

(g) use of new technologies or payment methods not used 

in the normal course of business by the FI; 

(h) products that have been particularly subject to fraud 

and market abuse, such as low -priced /small -cap and 192 

thinly-traded stocks; 

(i) the purchase of securities using physical cash; and 

(j) securities-related products or services funded by 

payments from or instructions given by unexpected 

third parties, particularly from jurisdictions posing a

higher risk. 

Examples of products, services or transactions that may be 

considered to carry lower ML/TF risk include: 

(a) specific types of products that may be eligible for SDD 

as set out in paragraph 4.8.15. 

4 Delivery/distribution channel risk 

Examples of delivery/distribution channels that may present 

higher ML/TF risk include: 

(a) business relationships established using a non-face-to-

face approach or transactions conducted by customer 

through non-face-to-face channels, where increased 

risks (e.g. impersonation or identity fraud) could not be 

adequately mitigated and/or are more susceptible to 

risk situations such as unauthorised trading and related 

ML/TF abuse; and 

(b) products or services distributed or sold through 

intermediaries (i.e. business relationship between an FI 

and the end customer may become indirect), especially 

if the intermediaries are: 

(i) suspected of criminal activities, particularly financial 

crimes or association with criminal associates; 

(ii) located in a higher risk country or in a country with a 

weak AML/CFT regime; 

(iii) serving high risk customers without appropriate risk 

mitigating measures; or 

(iv) with a history of non-compliance with laws or 

regulation or that have been the subject of relevant 

negative attention from credible media or law 

enforcement. 

Examples of delivery/distribution channels that may be 

considered to carry lower ML/TF risk include: 193 

(a) business relationships established or transactions 

conducted by customers through channels that are less 

susceptible to risk situations such as unauthorised 

trading and related ML/TF abuse; and 

(b) products or services distributed or sold directly to the 

customer. 194 

# APPENDIX B Illustrative indicators of 

# suspicious transactions and 

# activities 

The following is a list of non-exhaustive illustrative indicators of 

suspicious transactions and activities that may help assess whether or 

not transactions and activities might give rise to grounds of ML/TF 

suspicion. 

1 Customer-related 

(a) A customer who has no discernible reason for using the 

FI’s services (e.g. a customer has opened an account 

for discretionary management services but directs the 

FI to carry out his own investment decisions or a

customer located in a place outside Hong Kong who 

uses local accounts to trade on stock or futures 

exchanges located in that place); 

(b) A customer who has requested, without reasonable 

explanation, transactions that are out of the ordinary 

range of services normally requested, or are outside the 

experience of the financial services business in relation 

to the particular customer; 

(c) Extensive use of trusts or offshore structures in 

circumstances where the customer’s needs are 

inconsistent with the use of such services; 

(d) A legal person customer with bearer shares constituting 

a large part of its issued capital; 

(e) A customer who has opened multiple accounts with the 

same beneficial owners or controlling parties for no 

apparent business reason; 

(f) A customer’s legal or mailing address is associated with 

other apparently unrelated accounts; or does not seem 

connected to the customer; 

(g) Requests by customers for dealing or investment 

management services (with regard to securities, futures 

contracts or leveraged foreign exchange contracts) 

where the source of the funds is unclear or not 

consistent with the customers' profile and apparent 

standing; 

(h) A customer who refuses to provide the information 195 

requested without reasonable explanation or who 

otherwise refuses to cooperate with the CDD and/or 

ongoing monitoring process; 

(i) A customer who has entered into a business 

relationship uses the relationship for a single 

transaction or for only a very short period without a 

reasonable explanation; 

(j) A customer who exhibits unusual concern with the FI’s 

AML/CFT Systems including policies, controls, 

monitoring or reporting thresholds; 

(k) A customer who does not exhibit any concern with the 

cost of transactions or fees; and 

(l) A customer who is known to have criminal, civil or 

regulatory proceedings against it for corruption, misuse 

of public funds, other financial crimes or regulatory non-

compliance, or is known to associate with such 

persons. 

2 Trading-related 

(a) Transactions or instructions which have no apparent 

legitimate purpose or commercial rationale or involve 

apparently unnecessary complexity; 

(b) The size or pattern of transactions is not in line with the 

background of the customer or its past transaction 

volume/pattern; 

(c) Buying and selling of securities, futures or leveraged 

foreign exchange contracts with no discernible purpose 

or where the nature, size or frequency of the 

transactions appears unusual. For example, where a 

customer frequently purchases securities at a high price 

and subsequently sells them at a considerable loss to 

the same party. This may indicate transferring value 

from one party to another; 

(d) A number of transactions by the same customer in 

small amounts relating to the same investment, each 

purchased for cash and then sold in one transaction, 

the proceeds being paid to a person other than that 

customer; 

(e) Mirror trades or transactions involving securities used 

for currency conversion for illegitimate or no apparent 

business purposes; 

(f) Securities, futures or leveraged foreign exchange 196 

contracts transactions occur across many jurisdictions, 

and in particular jurisdictions posing a higher risk; 

(g) Securities intended to be held-to-maturity are unwound 

before maturity in the absence of volatile market 

conditions or other logical or apparent reason; and 

(h) Suspected front-running of other pending customer 

orders. 

3 Selected indicators of market manipulation 185 and 

insider dealing 

(a) Making a large purchase or sale of a security, or option 

on a security, shortly before news or a significant 

announcement is issued that affects the price of the 

security, which may be suggestive of potential insider 

trading or market manipulation; 

(b) A request to execute or clear a buy order and sell order 

in close chronological sequence for accounts with the 

same beneficial owner or of connected persons in the 

same securities which are thinly-traded; 

(c) Multiple new customers are referred by the same 

individual to open accounts for trading in the same 

security within a short period of time; 

(d) A customer engages in prearranged or other non-

competitive trading in particular securities or futures 

contracts; 

(e) The entry of matching buy and sell orders in particular

not result in a bona fide market position, which might 

also provide “cover” for a money launderer; 

(f) Transfers of positions between accounts that do not 

appear to be commonly controlled; 

(g) Accumulation of a security with small increments in 

price throughout the trading day to increase the price of 

the security; 

(h) Executing purchase or sale orders for one or more 

accounts in a security regularly at or near the close of  

> 185 FIs are expected to take appropriate steps to ensure that proper safeguards exist to prevent the
> firm from acting in a way which would result in the firm perpetrating any conduct which
> constitutes market misconduct under section 274, 275 or 278 of the SFO, or any criminal
> offence under section 295, 296 or 299 of the SFO. 197

market trading hours that alter the closing price of the 

security; and 

(i) Placing multiple buy or sell orders and cancelling some 

or all of them before execution regularly. 

4 Related to deposits of securities 

(a) The customer’s explanation regarding the method of 

acquiring the physical share certificates deposited at 

the FI does not make sense or changes; 

(b) A customer has a pattern of depositing physical share 

certificates or receiving incoming share transfers, 

forthwith selling the shares and transferring out the 

proceeds; 

(c) A customer with limited or no other assets at the FI 

receives a transfer of large amounts of thinly-traded 

securities; and 

(d) A customer deposits securities and requests to credit 

them to multiple accounts that do not appear to be 

related, and to sell or otherwise transfer ownership of 

the securities. 

5 Related to settlement and movement of funds and 

securities 

(a) Large or unusual settlements of transactions in cash or 

bearer form or where a customer only deals with an FI 

in cash; 

(b) A customer uses an FI to make payments or to hold 

funds or other property that are rarely used or are not 

being used to trade in securities, futures contracts or 

leveraged foreign exchange contracts, i.e. account 

appears to be used as a depositary account or a

conduit for transfers; 

(c) Non-resident customer’s account with very large 

account movements and subsequent fund transfers to 

offshore financial centres;

difficult to verify; 198 

(f) Transfers to and from jurisdictions posing a higher risk 

without reasonable explanation, which are not 

consistent with the customer’s declared business 

dealings or interests; 

(g) The involvement of offshore companies on whose 

accounts multiple transfers are made, especially when 

they are destined for a tax haven, and to accounts in 

the name of offshore companies of which the customer 

may be a shareholder; 

(h) Transactions appear to be undertaken in a structured, 

sequential manner in order to avoid transaction 

monitoring threshold; 

(i) Transfers of funds or securities to the same person 

from different parties, or to different persons from the 

same party without reasonable explanation; 

(j) Funds are transferred to other FIs in different 

jurisdictions from the FI where the funds were initially 

received; and 

(k) Frequent changes of bank account details or 

information for receiving investment sale proceeds. 

6 Employee-related 

(a) Changes in employee characteristics, e.g. lavish life 

styles or avoiding taking holidays without reasonable 

cause;

home or office address, e.g. utilisation of an employee’s 

address for the dispatch of customer documentation or 

correspondence. 199

3 Examples of possible measures in relation to the 

verification of the name, legal form and current 

existence of a customer that is a legal person  

> Para. 4.2.6 of
> this Guideline

Examples of possible measures to verify the name, 

legal form and current existence of a legal person: 

for a locally incorporated company: 

(a) performing a search of file at the Hong Kong 

Company Registry to obtain a company report 

(or obtaining from the customer a certified true 

copy of a company search report issued and 

certified by a company registry or professional 

person); 

for a company incorporated overseas: 

(b) performing a similar company search enquiry of 

the registry in the place of incorporation to 

obtain a company report; 

(c) obtaining a certificate of incumbency or 

equivalent issued by the company’s registered 

agent in the place of incorporation (or accepting 

a certified true copy of a certificate of 

incumbency certified by a professional person); 

or 

(d) obtaining a similar or comparable document to a 

company search report or a certificate of 

incumbency certified by a professional person in 

the relevant jurisdiction. 202 

4 Examples of simplified and enhanced measures 

in verifying the identity of a customer that is a 

legal person, trust or other similar legal 

arrangement 

> Para. 4.2.14
> of this
> Guideline

Simplified measures 

Where the assessed ML/TF risks are lower, an FI 

may consider to accept documents, data or 

information other than the examples provided in 

paragraphs 4.2.6 and 4.2.11, when verifying the 

name, legal form and current existence of the 

customer, or powers that regulate and bind the 

customer. Examples of such other documents, data 

or information include: 

(a) where the customer is 

(i) an FI as defined in the AMLO; or 

(ii) other FI that is incorporated or established in 

an equivalent jurisdiction, carry on a

business similar to that carried out by an FI 

as defined in the AMLO, and subject to and 

supervised for compliance with AML/CFT 

requirements consistent with standards set 

by the FATF, 

a proof that the customer is a licensed (and 

supervised) FI in the jurisdiction concerned; 

(b) where the customer is a listed company, a proof 

of its listed status; 

(c) where the customer is the government or a

public body in Hong Kong or in an equivalent 

jurisdiction, a proof that the customer is the 

government or a public body; and 

(d) where the customer is a collective investment 

scheme authorised for offering to the public in 

Hong Kong or in an equivalent jurisdiction, a 

proof of its authorisation status. 

Enhanced measures 

Where the assessed ML/TF risks are higher, in 

addition to verifying the name, legal form and 

current existence of the customer, and powers that 203 

regulate and bind the customer in accordance with 

paragraphs 4.2.6 and 4.2.11, an FI should decide 

whether additional information in respect of the 

customer, its operation and the individuals behind it 

should be obtained and the extent of further 

verification that is required. 

5 Examples of information which may be collected 

to identify the intermediate layers of the 

corporate structure of a legal person with 

multiple layers in its ownership structure 

> Para. 4.3.13
> of this
> Guideline

If the customer’s ownership structure consists of 

multiple layers of companies, an FI should 

determine on a risk-sensitive basis the amount of 

information in relation to the intermediate layers to 

be collected, which may include obtaining a

director’s declaration incorporating or annexing an 

ownership chart describing the intermediate layers 

(the information to be included should be 

determined on a risk-sensitive basis but at a

minimum should include company name and place 

of incorporation, and where applicable, the rationale 

behind the particular structure employed). 

FIs need not, as a matter of routine, verify the 

details of the intermediate companies in the 

ownership structure of a company. Complex 

ownership structures (e.g. structures involving 

multiple layers, different jurisdictions, trusts, etc.) 

without an obvious commercial purpose pose an 

increased risk and may require further steps to 

ensure that the FI is satisfied on reasonable 

grounds as to the identities of the beneficial owners. 

The need to verify the intermediate corporate layers 

of the ownership structure of a company will 

therefore depend upon the FI’s overall 

understanding of the structure, its assessment of 

the risks and whether the information available is 

adequate in the circumstances for the FI to consider 

if it has taken adequate measures to identify the 

beneficial owners. 204 

Where the ownership is dispersed, the FI may 

concentrate on identifying and taking reasonable 

measures to verify the identities of those who 

exercise ultimate control over the management of 

the company. 

6 Examples of procedures to establish whether 

the identification documents offered by 

customers are genuine, or have been reported 

as lost or stolen  

> Para. 4.5.3 of
> this Guideline

If suspicions are raised in relation to any 

identification document offered by customers, FIs 

should take whatever practical and proportionate 

steps that are available to establish whether the 

document offered is genuine, or has been reported 

as lost or stolen. This may include: 

(a) searching publicly available information; 

(b) approaching relevant authorities (such as the 

Immigration Department through its hotline); or 

(c) requesting corroboratory evidence from the 

customer. Where suspicion cannot be 

eliminated, the document should not be 

accepted and consideration should be given to 

making a report to the authorities. 205 

7 Use of an independent and appropriate person 

to certify identification documents 

> Para. 4.10.5
> of this
> Guideline

7.1 Use of an independent 189 and appropriate person to 

certify verification of identification documents guards 

against the risk that documentation provided does 

not correspond to the customer whose identity is 

being verified. However, for certification to be 

effective, the certifier will need to have seen the 

original documentation. 

7.2 The following is a list of non-exhaustive examples of 

appropriate persons to certify verification of 

identification documents: 

(a) an intermediary specified in section 18(3) of 

Schedule 2; 

(b) a member of the judiciary in an equivalent 

jurisdiction; 

(c) an officer of an embassy, consulate or high 

commission of the country of issue of 

documentary verification of identity; 

(d) a Justice of the Peace; and 

(e) other professional person 190 such as certified 

public accountant, lawyer, notary public and 

chartered secretary 191 .

7.3 The certifier should sign and date the copy 

document (printing his/her name clearly in capitals 

underneath) and clearly indicate his/her position or 

capacity on it. The certifier should state that it is a 

true copy of the original (or words to similar effect).     

> 189 In general, it is not sufficient for the copy documents to be self-certified by the customer.
> However, an FI may accept the copy documents certified by a professional person within a legal
> person customer if that professional person is subject to the professional conduct requirements
> of a relevant professional body, and has certified the copy documents in his or her professional
> capacity.
> 190 An FI may accept other appropriate professional person as certifier. The FI should have due
> consideration to paragraph 7.4 of Appendix C in similar manner to other types of appropriate
> certifiers being used.
> 191 A chartered secretary refers to a current member of The Chartered Governance Institute
> (formerly The Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators) who has attained the
> chartered status. 206

7.4 FIs remain liable for failure to carry out prescribed 

CDD and therefore should exercise caution when 

considering accepting certified copy documents, 

especially where such documents originate from a 

country perceived to represent a high risk, or from 

unregulated entities in any jurisdiction. 

In any circumstances where an FI is unsure of the 

authenticity of certified documents, or that the 

documents relate to the customer, FIs should take 

additional measures to mitigate the ML/TF risk. 

8 Examples of trigger events upon which existing 

records of customers should be reviewed  

> Para. 5.2 of
> this Guideline

Examples of trigger events include: 

(a) when a significant transaction 192 is to take place; 

(b) when a material change occurs in the way the 

customer’s account is operated 193 ;

(c) when the FI’s customer documentation 

standards change substantially; or 

(d) when the FI is aware that it lacks sufficient 

information about the customer concerned.    

> 192 The word “significant” is not necessarily linked to monetary value. It may include transactions
> that are unusual or not in line with the FI’s knowledge of the customer.
> 193 Reference should also be made to section 6 of Schedule 2 “Provisions relating to Pre-Existing
> Customers”. 207
