# Supplemental Joint Circular on Intermediaries' Virtual Asset-Related Activities

## Overview

This circular is supplemental to the Joint circular on intermediaries' virtual asset-related activities issued by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on 22 December 2023 (Joint Circular). It aims to update relevant licensing or registration conditions and terms and conditions for intermediaries.

## Background

The Joint Circular sets out the requirements for intermediaries which intend to or are engaging in certain virtual asset dealing services, advisory services, asset management services and/or distribution of investment products with exposure to virtual assets (virtual asset-related activities).

The SFC and the HKMA have conducted a review of the Joint Circular in light of the latest market development and industry feedback. Based on the review, the SFC and the HKMA jointly introduce some refinements and relaxations to the requirements with a view to facilitating market development while adhering to investor protection.

**Note on Stablecoins:** For activities involving specified stablecoins issued by an issuer licensed by the HKMA under the Stablecoins Ordinance (Cap.656), the SFC and the HKMA will issue further guidance in the near future.

## Key Updates

### 1. Staking Activities by Intermediaries

Given the SFC has issued requirements on staking for SFC-licensed platforms and SFC-authorised virtual asset funds, and the HKMA has issued similar guidance for authorized financial institutions and subsidiaries of locally incorporated authorized financial institution, both regulators are now prepared to allow intermediaries to provide staking services to their clients.

**Definition of "Staking Activities":**
Any activities carried out by licensed corporations or registered institutions on behalf of its clients which involve the process of committing or locking client virtual assets to participate in a blockchain protocol's validation process based on a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, with returns generated and distributed for that participation.

**Requirements:**
- Intermediaries may provide staking services to clients for whom they are dealing in virtual assets
- Should only do so through segregated account(s) maintained with an SFC-licensed platform or an authorized financial institution (or a subsidiary of a locally incorporated authorized financial institution)
- Must comply with requirements relating to the disclosure of information and risks

### 2. Use of Off-Platform Services of SFC-Licensed Platforms

In relation to the provision of virtual asset dealing services to clients, licensed corporations and registered institutions may now execute a trade via the off-platform virtual asset trading services of SFC-licensed platforms.

**Note:** Clause 4.2 of the Terms and Conditions has been removed.

### 3. Subscribing for or Redeeming Investment Products Using Virtual Assets

The SFC and the HKMA clarify that client's subscriptions and redemptions of investment products using virtual assets or in-kind subscriptions or redemptions of virtual asset funds will not be treated as providing virtual asset dealing services.

**Requirements for Relevant Intermediaries:**

(a) Notify the SFC (and the HKMA, where applicable) of such activities in advance

(b) Hold the virtual assets in account(s) established and maintained with SFC-licensed platforms or an authorized financial institution (or a subsidiary of a locally incorporated authorized financial institution)
- Exception: virtual asset portfolio managers and virtual asset discretionary account managers which have the RA9 Terms and conditions imposed on their licences or registrations

(c) Ensure compliance with the applicable requirements under Chapter 12 of the Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (For Licensed Corporations and SFC-licensed Virtual Asset Service Providers) when handling virtual asset deposits and withdrawals conducted for clients

### 4. Distribution of Investment Products with Exposure to Virtual Assets

**Clarification on Net Worth Requirement:**
The requirement in Paragraph 6.2 of the Joint Circular (ensuring clients have sufficient net worth to assume risks and bear potential losses of trading virtual asset-related products) does NOT apply to:
- Institutional professional investors
- Qualified corporate professional investors

**Risk Disclosure Statements:**
The requirement to provide clients with risk disclosure statements specific to virtual asset futures contracts does NOT apply to:
- Institutional professional investors
- Qualified corporate professional investors

## Implementation

Intermediaries are reminded to notify the SFC (and the HKMA, where applicable) before making changes to their virtual asset-related activities, including:

(a) The type(s) of clientele served

(b) Allowing clients to deposit or withdraw virtual assets from the intermediaries' accounts for the first time

(c) Providing staking services to their clients for the first time

(d) Allowing their clients to subscribe for or redeem products using virtual assets for the first time
