## Overview

- **Authority**: Financial Action Task Force (FATF)

## Part 1 - High-Risk Jurisdictions (Black List)

### Definition

Countries with significant strategic deficiencies in their AML/CFT/CPF regimes. FATF calls on all members to apply enhanced due diligence and, in most serious cases, countermeasures.

### Current Black List (October 2025)

| Jurisdiction | Status | Required Actions |
|--------------|--------|------------------|
| **Iran** | Countermeasures | Apply countermeasures proportionate to risks |
| **Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)** | Countermeasures | Apply countermeasures proportionate to risks |
| **Myanmar** | Enhanced Due Diligence | Apply enhanced due diligence only |

### Countermeasures

For Iran and DPRK, jurisdictions should consider:
- Limiting or prohibiting financial transactions
- Prohibiting establishment of subsidiaries or branches
- Limiting business relationships
- Enhanced reporting requirements
- Requiring increased external audit

### Enhanced Due Diligence

For Myanmar and other high-risk countries:
- Obtain additional information on customer and beneficial owner
- Obtain senior management approval for new relationships
- Conduct enhanced ongoing monitoring
- Consider purpose and reason for transactions

## Part 2 - Jurisdictions Under Increased Monitoring (Grey List)

### Definition

Countries actively working with FATF to address strategic deficiencies under agreed timelines. Not subject to countermeasures but require enhanced due diligence.

### October 2025 Changes

**Removed from Grey List:**
- Burkina Faso
- Mozambique
- Nigeria
- South Africa

### Current Grey List (as of October 2025)

| **Asia-Pacific** | Philippines, Vietnam |
| **Europe** | Bulgaria, Croatia |
| **Middle East** | Syria, Yemen |
| **Americas** | Haiti, Jamaica, Venezuela |

*Note: List subject to change. Verify against official FATF publications.*

### Required Actions for Grey List

## Part 3 - Compliance Requirements

### Enhanced Due Diligence Triggers

Transactions involving high-risk or grey-listed jurisdictions require:

| Requirement | Black List | Grey List |
|-------------|------------|-----------|
| Additional customer information | Mandatory | Risk-based |
| Senior management approval | Mandatory | Recommended |
| Enhanced ongoing monitoring | Mandatory | Required |
| Source of funds verification | Mandatory | Risk-based |
| Purpose of transaction documentation | Mandatory | Risk-based |

### Transaction Monitoring

For jurisdictions on either list:
1. Flag transactions for manual review
2. Investigate unusual patterns
3. Document rationale for proceeding
4. Consider STR filing if suspicious

### Record Keeping

- Document all EDD measures taken
- Retain records for regulatory period (typically 5-6 years)
- Be prepared for regulatory inspection

## Part 4 - Virtual Asset Considerations

### VA-Specific Risks

| Risk Factor | Consideration |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Sanctions evasion** | VAs used to circumvent financial sanctions |
| **Anonymity** | Privacy coins and mixers obscure origins |
| **Cross-border** | Rapid cross-border movement without intermediaries |
| **DeFi** | Decentralized protocols may lack controls |

### VASP Obligations

- Screen wallet addresses against sanctions lists
- Apply geographic risk scoring to counterparties
- Monitor for patterns indicating sanctions evasion
- Report suspicious activities to authorities

### High-Risk Indicators

- Transactions with known high-risk jurisdiction VASPs
- Wallet addresses associated with sanctioned entities
- Patterns suggesting layering through multiple jurisdictions
- Use of privacy-enhancing technologies
